# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Dynamic typing for v0

**Decision**: The v0 interpreter does not include a type checker. Types are parsed but not verified at compile time. Runtime type tags (on the Value enum) are used for `is`/`has` checks.

**Rationale**: A full bidirectional type system with generics, variance, and numeric widening is a multi-week effort. Dynamic execution lets us validate the language design and build a working demo overnight. Type checking can be layered on top later without changing the runtime semantics.

**Consequence**: All type annotations are parsed and stored in the AST but ignored at runtime.

## ADR-002: Built-in iteration functions instead of .lin stdlib

**Decision**: `for`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `range`, `iterOf`, and `iter` are implemented as built-in functions in the Rust interpreter rather than in .lin stdlib files.

**Rationale**: These functions need to invoke user callbacks (closures), which requires access to the interpreter's `call_value` method. Rust's `fn` pointer type cannot capture state, so native functions registered with a simple `fn(&[Value]) -> Result<Value, String>` signature cannot call back into the interpreter. Making them built-ins avoids this architectural constraint.

**Consequence**: The stdlib .lin files for `std/array` and `std/iter` are thin re-export wrappers (or unused). The built-ins are registered directly in the global environment.

## ADR-003: Range materializes as array

**Decision**: `range(start, end)` immediately materializes all values into a `Vec<Value>` (an Array) rather than producing a lazy iterator.

**Rationale**: Creating a true lazy iterator requires closures that capture the end-bound, which conflicts with the `fn` pointer approach used for native functions. Materializing as an array is simple and correct for v0. For typical ranges in test programs (< 10000 elements), this is not a performance concern.

**Consequence**: Very large ranges will allocate proportionally. A lazy implementation can be added in v1 when the iterator infrastructure is more mature.

## ADR-004: Objects suppress indentation tracking

**Decision**: When inside `{ }` (brace depth > 0), the lexer suppresses newline tokens and indentation tracking (no INDENT/DEDENT emitted).

**Rationale**: Multi-line JSON object literals must not trigger block parsing. This matches the behaviour for `( )` and `[ ]` which also suppress indentation.

**Consequence**: You cannot have indentation-significant syntax inside object literals (which is fine — object values are expressions, not statements).

## ADR-005: String interpolation as compound token

**Decision**: The lexer produces a single `InterpString(Vec<InterpPart>)` token for interpolated strings. Each `InterpPart::Expr` contains its own sub-token-stream that the parser processes independently.

**Rationale**: The initial approach of inlining interpolation tokens into the main token stream caused ordering issues with the pending-token queue. A compound token with embedded sub-streams is self-contained and avoids interaction with indentation tracking.

**Consequence**: Interpolation expressions are parsed in isolation (no access to outer indentation context), which is fine since they're always single expressions.

## ADR-006: Dot-chaining across newlines via lookahead

**Decision**: The parser's postfix expression loop checks for `.` across newline boundaries using a save/restore pattern. If a newline is followed by `.`, parsing continues the dot chain. Otherwise, position is restored.

**Rationale**: The spec requires `x\n  .f()` to chain. But aggressively skipping all indentation tokens breaks block structure. The save/restore pattern is conservative — it only consumes whitespace tokens when followed by a dot.

**Consequence**: Dot-chaining works across lines without breaking function bodies or if-then-else blocks.

## ADR-007: Bare identifier lambdas

**Decision**: The parser recognizes `name => body` (without parentheses) as a single-parameter lambda when used as a function argument.

**Rationale**: The spec's examples use this form extensively (`x => x * 2`, `n => print(n)`). Without this, every callback would need `(x) => x * 2`.

**Consequence**: `is_bare_lambda()` check applies only in argument position. A standalone `name => ...` at statement level would be ambiguous (could be assignment with `=>`?), but this doesn't arise in practice.

## ADR-008: Environment cloning for global scope

**Decision**: Top-level statements evaluate by cloning `global_env`, evaluating in the clone, then writing back to `global_env`.

**Rationale**: Rust's borrow checker prevents holding `&mut self` (needed for `call_value` and module loading) and `&mut self.global_env` simultaneously. Cloning is O(n) in bindings but avoids unsafe code or RefCell wrapping of the entire interpreter.

**Consequence**: Performance cost is negligible for typical programs. A future version could use `Rc<RefCell<Env>>` for zero-copy sharing.

## ADR-009: Stdlib string functions as native intrinsics

**Decision**: `trim`, `toUpper`, `toLower` are implemented as Rust native functions (`__stringTrim`, etc.) exposed through .lin wrapper files.

**Rationale**: String manipulation requires access to Rust's `str` methods which cannot be expressed in lin itself. The .lin files provide the public API surface while the Rust code provides the implementation.

**Consequence**: The stdlib is a mix of .lin re-exports and Rust intrinsics, achieving the "thin runtime, fat stdlib" goal as much as possible given the language's constraints.

## ADR-010: Multi-line if/then/else with indent consumption

**Decision**: The parser consumes an INDENT token that may appear before `then`/`else` in multi-line if expressions, and matches a trailing DEDENT.

**Rationale**: When `if` condition is on one line and `then`/`else` are indented on subsequent lines, the lexer produces INDENT/DEDENT pairs. The parser must explicitly handle these to avoid confusing them with block boundaries.

**Consequence**: All three spec-defined if layouts (single-line, multi-line same indent, multi-line with block branches) parse correctly.
