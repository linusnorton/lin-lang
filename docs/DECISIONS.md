# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Static typing via lin-check

**Decision**: All Lin programs are type-checked before codegen. The `lin-check` crate performs bidirectional inference, structural typing, union narrowing, and exhaustiveness checking. Runtime type tags still exist in the runtime for `is`/`has` pattern dispatch, but no program should reach codegen with unresolved type errors.

**Rationale**: A full bidirectional type system with generics, variance, and numeric widening allows LLVM to emit unboxed primitives and enables helpful compile-time error messages.

**Consequence**: Type annotations are parsed, checked, and emitted into `TypedModule`. The `lin-check` crate owns all type inference logic.

## ADR-002: Minimal built-ins, stdlib for iteration

**Decision**: Only `lin_for` and `lin_iter` are compiler intrinsics with special codegen. Higher-level functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `range`, `iterOf`) are implemented in `.lin` stdlib files (`std/array`) and must be explicitly imported by user code.

**Rationale**: `lin_for` and `lin_iter` require special compiler treatment (inline loop emission, iterator struct construction). All other iteration functions can be expressed in Lin itself. Keeping intrinsics minimal means the runtime stays small and the stdlib is readable Lin code.

**Consequence**: `range()` returns a lazy `Iterator`. User code imports `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc. from `std/array`. The compiler recognises `lin_for`/`lin_iter` by name and emits them as native loops rather than function calls.

## ADR-004: Objects suppress indentation tracking

**Decision**: When inside `{ }` (brace depth > 0), the lexer suppresses newline tokens and indentation tracking (no INDENT/DEDENT emitted).

**Rationale**: Multi-line JSON object literals must not trigger block parsing. This matches the behaviour for `( )` and `[ ]` which also suppress indentation.

**Consequence**: You cannot have indentation-significant syntax inside object literals (which is fine — object values are expressions, not statements).

## ADR-005: String interpolation as compound token

**Decision**: The lexer produces a single `InterpString(Vec<InterpPart>)` token for interpolated strings. Each `InterpPart::Expr` contains its own sub-token-stream that the parser processes independently.

**Rationale**: The initial approach of inlining interpolation tokens into the main token stream caused ordering issues with the pending-token queue. A compound token with embedded sub-streams is self-contained and avoids interaction with indentation tracking.

**Consequence**: Interpolation expressions are parsed in isolation (no access to outer indentation context), which is fine since they're always single expressions.

## ADR-006: Dot-chaining across newlines via lookahead

**Decision**: The parser's postfix expression loop checks for `.` across newline boundaries using a save/restore pattern. If a newline is followed by `.`, parsing continues the dot chain. Otherwise, position is restored.

**Rationale**: The spec requires `x\n  .f()` to chain. But aggressively skipping all indentation tokens breaks block structure. The save/restore pattern is conservative — it only consumes whitespace tokens when followed by a dot.

**Consequence**: Dot-chaining works across lines without breaking function bodies or if-then-else blocks.

## ADR-007: Bare identifier lambdas

**Decision**: The parser recognizes `name => body` (without parentheses) as a single-parameter lambda when used as a function argument.

**Rationale**: The spec's examples use this form extensively (`x => x * 2`, `n => print(n)`). Without this, every callback would need `(x) => x * 2`.

**Consequence**: `is_bare_lambda()` check applies only in argument position. A standalone `name => ...` at statement level would be ambiguous (could be assignment with `=>`?), but this doesn't arise in practice.

## ADR-008: Module-level environment isolation in the compiler

**Decision**: Each module is type-checked in its own scope. Imports from other modules are resolved before the importing module is checked, with each module's public exports available as a `ModuleSignature`.

**Rationale**: Modules must not pollute each other's namespaces. The compiler uses a module cache keyed by source hash so unchanged modules are not re-checked.

**Consequence**: Circular imports within a single init chain are detected at compile time. Each module's checked `TypedModule` is cached and reused by all importers.

## ADR-009: Stdlib functions as thin Lin wrappers over runtime intrinsics

**Decision**: String, array, object, and IO operations are implemented as C-ABI functions in `lin-runtime` (e.g. `lin_string_trim`, `lin_fs_read_file`) and declared in stdlib `.lin` files via `import foreign "lin-runtime"`. The `.lin` files provide the public API surface.

**Rationale**: String/IO manipulation requires Rust code. The .lin wrapper layer keeps the user-facing API in Lin, making stdlib readable and testable in the same language. The compiler recognises `"lin-runtime"` as a reserved path and always links the runtime archive.

**Consequence**: The stdlib is a mix of pure-Lin logic and thin `lin-runtime` wrappers. Adding a new runtime function requires both a `#[no_mangle] pub unsafe extern "C" fn lin_xxx` in `lin-runtime/src/` and an exported wrapper in the appropriate `stdlib/*.lin` file.

## ADR-010: Multi-line if/then/else syntax

**Decision**: `then` always appears on the condition line (or the last continuation line of the condition). The body follows on an indented block (INDENT … DEDENT). `else` appears at the same indent level as `if`. The parser does not consume any INDENT before `then` — it simply expects `then` after the condition expression.

**Rationale**: Placing `then` at the end of the condition line is clearer and more consistent with how block-opening keywords work in other languages. The old approach of allowing `then` on its own indented line required the parser to tentatively consume an INDENT token before `then`, then emit a corresponding DEDENT, making the grammar more complex with three special-case DEDENT guards. The new rule is simpler: condition, `then`, body block, `else` at original indent, else body.

**Consequence**: All spec-defined if layouts (single-line, multi-line with block body, multi-line with inline body) parse correctly. Condition continuation lines with `&&`/`||` end with `then` on the last continuation line. The `then_indented` tracking variable and its three associated DEDENT guards have been removed from `parse_if_expr`.

## ADR-011: Postfix suppression after DEDENT

**Decision**: The parser's postfix expression loop (`[` and `(`) is suppressed when the immediately preceding consumed token was a DEDENT. Dot-chaining (`.`) is still allowed (as it handles cross-line chaining via a separate lookahead mechanism).

**Rationale**: After a block-bodied function expression like `() => \n  42`, the lexer produces `... IntLit(42) Newline Dedent LBracket ...` — the inner block's `skip_newlines` consumes the Newline, so after the Dedent is consumed, no Newline separates the function from the next line's `[`. Without this guard, `[x]` at the outer block level is incorrectly parsed as index access on the function expression.

**Consequence**: Array/object literals at block level after indented function definitions parse correctly as separate expressions. Same-line index access (`f()[0]`) still works because no DEDENT intervenes.

## ADR-012: Tail call optimization via eval_tail_expr

**Decision**: TCO is implemented by introducing a `TailResult` enum (`Return(Value)` | `TailCall(Vec<Value>)`) and an `eval_tail_expr` method that recognizes self-recursive calls in tail position and returns `TailCall` instead of making a new frame.

**Rationale**: The spec (§27.3) requires direct self-recursive tail calls to run in constant stack space. A trampoline approach avoids modifying the normal `eval_expr_in_env` code path — only `call_function` loops on `TailCall`. Tail positions are: the body of a function, both branches of `if/then/else`, the final expression of a block, and match arm bodies.

**Consequence**: `sum(100000, 0)` runs without stack overflow. Non-tail recursive calls (e.g., `n * factorial(n-1)`) still recurse normally. Mutual recursion is not optimized (per spec: "Mutual tail recursion is not required to be optimised in v1").

## ADR-013: Continuation line parsing via lookahead in and/or expressions

**Decision**: `parse_and_expr` and `parse_or_expr` use a `skip_continuation_newline` helper that looks past Newline tokens for `&&`/`||`. If found, parsing continues the expression; otherwise position is restored.

**Rationale**: The lexer suppresses INDENT/DEDENT for lines starting with `&&`/`||` (per spec §3.2), but still emits a Newline token at the end of the preceding line. Without the parser skip, `x >= 5\n  && active` would parse as just `x >= 5`.

**Consequence**: Multi-line boolean expressions and `if` conditions with continuation lines work as specified.

## ADR-014: Inline block parsing for lambda bodies inside parentheses

**Decision**: `parse_function_body` always delegates to `parse_inline_block` when there is no `Indent` token ahead. `parse_inline_block` collects statements until it sees `Newline`, `)`, `]`, `}`, `,`, `Dedent`, or EOF, then returns either the single expression or an `Expr::Block` wrapping all collected statements.

**Rationale**: Inside parentheses, brackets, or braces, the lexer suppresses all INDENT/DEDENT and Newline tokens (ADR-004), so `parse_expr_or_block` cannot detect a multi-statement body. At top level, Newline tokens are present and `parse_inline_block` breaks on them, making it behave identically to `parse_expr` for the single-expression case. The break conditions `]` and `}` prevent over-consuming array and object literal contents. `Comma` ensures argument-list lambdas (e.g. `iter(() => 0, i => i + 1)`) parse correctly.

The earlier version used `val`/`var` as the trigger for multi-statement inline bodies. That was too narrow — bare expression side-effects (calls to `print`, `writeFile`, etc.) were silently dropped, leaving only the first expression evaluated.

**Consequence**: Bare side-effect sequences work in both inline and indented lambda bodies:

```txt
[1, 2, 3].for(x =>
  print("before")    // executed
  print(toString(x)) // executed
)

val myFunc = () =>
  print("first")     // executed
  print("second")    // executed
  42                 // return value
```

## ADR-015: Forward references between top-level functions via mutable cells

**Decision**: Before evaluating a module's statements, a pre-scan registers all `val name = (...) => ...` bindings (function expressions with named pattern) as mutable cells holding `Null`. During evaluation, each function's closure captures the environment containing these cells. When the actual definition is reached, the cell is updated with the real function value.

**Rationale**: The spec (§7.3) expects mutual recursion between top-level functions. Without forward declaration, functions must be defined before use, which prevents mutual recursion and requires careful ordering. The mutable-cell approach solves this without changing evaluation semantics — a function that calls another function reads the cell at call time, by which point the definition has been evaluated.

**Consequence**: Forward references work between functions (e.g., `isEven` calling `isOdd` and vice versa). However, eager top-level evaluation that *immediately* calls a forward-referenced function (before its definition is evaluated) will still fail with "Cannot call value of type Null". This is inherent to sequential evaluation and matches the behavior of languages like JavaScript (`let` before initialization).

## ADR-016: User module loading from filesystem

**Decision**: When an import path does not match a `std/` prefix, the interpreter resolves it relative to the importing file's directory by appending `.lin` to the path.

**Rationale**: Multi-file programs need to import user-defined modules. The resolution strategy mirrors Node.js-style relative imports without requiring a leading `./` — the `std/` prefix is the only special case, everything else is relative.

**Consequence**: `import { x } from "lib/math"` in `examples/main.lin` loads `examples/lib/math.lin`. Absolute paths and `..` traversal work naturally via the filesystem.

## ADR-017: Reset at_line_start unconditionally in lexer

**Decision**: The `at_line_start` flag is always reset to false at the top of `next_token()`, regardless of whether the lexer is inside balanced delimiters.

**Rationale**: Previously, `at_line_start` was only cleared when entering `handle_indentation()` (which requires `!inside_balanced()`). This left the flag true when a newline occurred inside braces (e.g., multi-line imports). When the closing brace brought depth back to 0, the stale `at_line_start = true` triggered spurious INDENT tokens on the next call. Always clearing the flag eliminates this class of bugs.

**Consequence**: Multi-line `import { ... } from "path"` statements work correctly. No change in behavior for other constructs since the flag is still set to true on `\n` when appropriate.

## ADR-018: `Number` as a built-in union alias

**Decision**: Add `Number` to the built-in types as a union alias for every numeric family (`Int8 | … | Float64`), and use it in the definition of `Json`. `Number` does not introduce a new runtime kind, a new subtype relation, or any new narrowing rule — it is exactly the union it expands to.

**Rationale**: Without a name for "any numeric," the `Json` type has to enumerate all sixteen numeric families to be accurate, and signatures that accept any numeric have no concise spelling. A true supertype with subtype assignability would introduce a third kind of type relation alongside structural typing and unions, and would force decisions about `is Number` narrowing, arithmetic on a `Number`-typed operand, and how widening (§26) interacts with the supertype. A union alias avoids all of that: `is Int32`, widening, and operator dispatch keep working exactly as they did, because under the hood there is still only a concrete numeric family at every site.

**Consequence**: Spec-only change in v0 (no type checker exists yet — `Number` already parses as a `TypeExpr::Named`). The future type checker treats `Number` as a union alias when resolving assignability and exhaustiveness. Runtime is unchanged: §27.4 still says every numeric value carries its specific family tag and there is no single `Number` representation.

## ADR-019: LLVM 22 via inkwell with dynamic linking

**Decision**: The compiler backend uses LLVM 22 (the latest stable release) via the `inkwell` 0.9.0 Rust wrapper, with the `llvm22-1-prefer-dynamic` feature flag for dynamic linking.

**Rationale**: LLVM 22 is the latest release with the best optimizations and codegen quality. The `prefer-dynamic` flag is required because Debian/Ubuntu package `LLVMPolly.so` as a dynamic library only — no `.a` static archive is provided. Without dynamic linking, the linker fails with "could not find native static library 'Polly'". The `inkwell` wrapper provides a safe, idiomatic Rust API over the LLVM C API and supports LLVM 22.

**Consequence**: The devcontainer installs LLVM 22 from `apt.llvm.org/bookworm` and sets `LLVM_SYS_221_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-22`. The compiled binary dynamically links against `libLLVM-22.so` at runtime, which is available on the devcontainer but would need to be present on deployment targets.

## ADR-020: Unboxed primitive value representation in LLVM IR

**Decision**: Numeric and boolean types are represented as bare LLVM primitives: `Int32` → `i32`, `Float64` → `double`, `Bool` → `i1`. Strings are represented as `ptr` to a heap-allocated `LinString` struct (refcount + len + bytes). Closures are represented as `ptr` to a `{ fn_ptr, env_ptr }` struct. Union types use a heap-allocated tagged representation.

**Rationale**: The type checker produces `TypedIR` with a concrete `Type` for every expression. This means we know at compile time whether a value is `i32` or `f64`, enabling LLVM to treat them as first-class register-width values rather than tagged `Value` boxes. The performance difference versus the tree-walker interpreter (which boxes everything in a `Value` enum) is typically 50–200×. Strings cannot be unboxed (variable-length), so they remain as pointers.

**Consequence**: No boxing for arithmetic, comparisons, boolean operations, or function calls on primitive types. LLVM's optimizer can treat these as register values and apply standard scalar optimizations. Union types and unknown-typed values (TypeVar) fall back to pointer representation.

## ADR-021: TCO via alloca/loop transform (not trampoline)

**Decision**: Tail-recursive functions are compiled using the "loop transform": parameters are stored in `alloca` slots, the function body is wrapped in a `tco_loop` basic block, and tail self-calls store updated argument values into the alloca slots and branch back to `tco_loop` rather than making a recursive call.

**Rationale**: The alloca/loop approach produces standard LLVM IR that LLVM's optimizer understands — it can apply `mem2reg` to promote the alloca slots to phi nodes, yielding optimal machine code. A trampoline approach (returning a thunk and looping externally) requires a heap allocation per tail call and more complex call-site machinery. The loop transform produces a native loop with no allocation overhead.

**Consequence**: Tail self-calls are identified by `is_tail: bool` in `TypedExpr::Call`, set by the checker when the call is in tail position and the callee is the current function. Non-tail recursive calls and mutual recursion still use normal stack frames. `mem2reg` (run as part of `default<O2>`) eliminates all alloca slots from the final machine code.

## ADR-022: Forward-declaration for top-level mutual recursion in codegen

**Decision**: Before compiling the body of any top-level function, `compile_module` pre-scans all `TypedStmt::Val` statements to LLVM-declare any function whose `TypedExpr::Function` has a `name`. These forward declarations are stored in `global_fn_slots` (slot → `FunctionValue`). Function bodies are compiled in a second pass. Direct calls look up `global_fn_slots` first, enabling sibling functions to call each other.

**Rationale**: LLVM requires a function to be declared before it is called. Without a pre-scan, a function `f` that calls `g` (defined later in the source) would not find `g`'s `FunctionValue` in the IR. The pre-scan mirrors ADR-015 (mutable cells for forward refs in the interpreter) but at the LLVM level. The checker's `forward_declare_functions` also pre-registers function types so the body's recursive references type-check correctly and reuse the same slot.

**Consequence**: Top-level mutual recursion works. The slot assigned during type-check pre-scan is reused (via `update_type`) when the actual `val` binding is processed, ensuring the codegen's `global_fn_slots` entry aligns with the slot referenced in call expressions.

## ADR-023: Runtime library as a static archive linked into every binary

**Decision**: `lin-runtime` is compiled as a Rust `staticlib` (`crate-type = ["staticlib", "rlib"]`) that provides C-ABI functions (`lin_print`, `lin_string_concat`, `lin_int_to_string`, `lin_array_alloc`, `lin_panic`, etc.). The compile pipeline locates the `.a` file and passes it to the system linker (`cc`) alongside the LLVM-emitted `.o` file.

**Rationale**: LLVM IR cannot express Rust-level operations like `write!` or `alloc::alloc`. The runtime provides these as well-known C symbols that LLVM IR can `declare` and call. A static archive avoids a runtime shared-library dependency on deployed binaries. Using the Rust `staticlib` crate type ensures `rustc` links in all needed Rust stdlib code (allocator, panic handler, etc.).

**Consequence**: Compiled Lin binaries are self-contained: they link against `libc` (via `cc`) plus the runtime `.a`, with no Lin-specific shared libraries required. The runtime is small (~10KB stripped) since it only contains the functions LLVM IR references.

## ADR-024: Binding name propagation for function identity

**Decision**: When the checker processes `Stmt::Val { pattern: Ident("f"), value: Function { ... } }`, the resulting `TypedExpr::Function { name: Some("f"), ... }` carries the binding name. This is done by detecting the pattern name in `check_stmt` and either calling `infer_function` with the name (enabling tail-call tracking via `current_function`) or patching `name` after inference.

**Rationale**: `TypedExpr::Function` has an optional `name` field used by the codegen to (a) emit a named LLVM function rather than an anonymous `__closure_N` and (b) enable `global_fn_slots` lookup for direct calls. The parser does not embed the binding name into the function expression (names come from the `val`/`var` statement's pattern), so the checker must propagate it. Setting `current_function` during body compilation is also required for tail-call detection (`is_tail_call` only fires when in tail position of the same function).

**Consequence**: Named top-level functions emit named LLVM functions (e.g., `@factorial`) rather than anonymous closures (`@__closure_0`). Recursive calls to the function are recognized as tail calls when in tail position, enabling the TCO loop transform (ADR-021).

## ADR-025: Closure capture analysis via scope depth tracking

**Decision**: Capture analysis is performed inline during type-checking. When `infer_function` is entered, the current scope depth is pushed onto `function_scope_depths`. During `LocalGet` inference, if the variable's scope depth is less than the innermost function's entry depth, it is recorded as a capture in `capture_stack`. The captures are sorted by `outer_slot` for deterministic codegen.

**Rationale**: A separate capture-analysis pass would need to traverse the typed IR a second time. Doing it inline avoids this while the scope information is naturally available. Scope depth (not slot number) is the right discriminant: variables from the current function's scope are parameters/locals; variables from outer scopes are captures. Stable sorting by slot ensures codegen produces deterministic env struct layouts.

**Consequence**: Closures that capture variables now correctly carry a `captures: Vec<Capture>` list in `TypedExpr::Function`. The codegen heap-allocates environment structs for captured variables and packs `{fn_ptr, env_ptr}` closure values on the heap (not the stack) to support closures that outlive their creating scope.

## ADR-026: Iterator representation as heap-allocated struct; inline for-loop codegen

**Decision**: `range(a, b)` returns a heap-allocated `{i32 start, i32 end}` struct. `for(iterable, body)` is compiled to an inline LLVM loop: for arrays, an i64 index loop with `lin_array_get` element access; for `Iterator<Int32>` (range result), a counted `i32` loop. The `body` closure is inlined — the codegen recognizes `TypedExpr::Function` and `TypedExpr::LocalGet` to avoid creating/calling a closure struct when the body is a literal lambda.

**Rationale**: General iterators need function-pointer dispatch. For the common `range(...).for(i => ...)` pattern, generating a direct counted loop is equivalent to a C `for` loop with no overhead. Array iteration avoids boxing by loading `LinArrayElem.payload` directly. `TypeVar` substitution was added to `infer_call` and `infer_dot_call` to propagate the element type into the body lambda's parameter when the `for` intrinsic's parameter types use `TypeVar`.

**Consequence**: `range(0, n).for(i => ...)` and `arr.for(x => ...)` compile to native loops. The `iter` intrinsic is supported but `map`/`filter`/`reduce` are not yet compiled (runtime panic). Bidirectional type checking was extended (`check_expr` now guides function argument inference using expected parameter types from the call site).

## ADR-027: Concurrency via OS threads

**Decision**: `async(thunk)` spawns a real OS thread. Results are communicated back via `Arc<Mutex<PromiseState>>`. `await` blocks the caller thread until the promise resolves. `ThreadPool` uses `mpsc::channel` with a fixed set of worker threads. `Worker` uses `mpsc::sync_channel` for backpressure.

**Rationale**: OS threads are heavyweight but correct: each thread runs independently with no shared mutable state between concurrent thunks. A true async executor (tokio) would require pervasive `async/await` in the runtime.

**Consequence**: `async` thunks run on true OS threads. `await` blocks the caller thread (not a coroutine yield). Values must be JSON-serializable to cross thread boundaries (spec §32.4).

## ADR-028: Cross-thread value transfer via JSON bridge

**Decision**: Values crossing thread boundaries are serialized to a `JsonValue` bridge type (no `Rc`, no `RefCell`) and deserialized on the receiving thread. Functions, iterators, promises, workers, and thread pools cannot cross thread boundaries.

**Rationale**: The compiled runtime uses refcounted heap pointers. Deep-copying at the thread boundary (via the bridge type) is unavoidable without adding `Arc`-based reference counting throughout.

**Consequence**: Async thunk return types must be JSON-compatible (spec §32.4). The serialization is O(size) but is the correct approach given the refcount model.

## ADR-029: JSON bridge type for cross-thread value transfer

**Decision**: `JsonValue` is a `Clone + Debug` enum (no `Rc`, no `RefCell`) that mirrors Lin's data types: `Null`, `Bool`, `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Array`, `Object`, `Error`. `Value::to_json_value()` converts at the thread boundary (returning `Err` for non-serializable types like `Function`). `JsonValue::to_value()` converts back in the receiving thread.

**Rationale**: `Value` contains `Rc<RefCell<...>>` for arrays and objects, which cannot be sent across threads. Instead of adding `Arc` alternatives, a separate bridge type that is fully `Clone + Send` provides a clean serialization point. This also enforces Lin's spec requirement (§32.4) that async thunk return types must be JSON-compatible.

**Consequence**: Closures, iterators, promises, workers, and thread pools cannot be returned from async thunks (they fail `to_json_value()` with an error). Deep copies are made at the thread boundary. For large objects this is O(size) but is unavoidable given the `Rc`-based value representation.

## ADR-030: IO/FS/HTTP implemented as `lin-runtime` C functions

**Decision**: IO, filesystem, HTTP client, and server operations are implemented as `#[no_mangle] pub unsafe extern "C"` functions in `lin-runtime` (e.g. `lin_io_read_line`, `lin_fs_read_file`, `lin_http_fetch`). Stdlib `.lin` files declare them via `import foreign "lin-runtime"` and expose clean user-facing names.

**Rationale**: IO requires Rust code. Keeping implementations in `lin-runtime` means the compiler just emits `call` instructions for them. The `.lin` wrapper layer keeps user-facing APIs in Lin.

**Consequence**: All IO/FS/HTTP is synchronous on the calling thread. Programs run IO in background threads via `async`/`threadPool`. The HTTP server blocks forever; typical usage is `async(() => serve(8080, handler))`. `tiny_http` was chosen for its simplicity (no tokio required).

## ADR-031: `std/io`, `std/fs`, `std/http`, `std/server` as thin Lin wrappers

**Decision**: Each IO module is a `.lin` file (`stdlib/io.lin`, `stdlib/fs.lin`, `stdlib/http.lin`, `stdlib/server.lin`) that re-exports `__*` intrinsics with clean names and provides Lin-level helpers (`fetchJson`, `postJson`, `json`, `text`, `parseBody`, etc.). They are registered via `include_str!` in `register_stdlib_sources` and loaded on demand when the user imports `std/io`, etc.

**Rationale**: Following the existing pattern (ADR-009): keep the Rust intrinsics small and focused; provide the user-facing API in Lin. This means helpers like `fetchJson` (fetch + parseJson) and `pathMatch` routing can be written in Lin without touching Rust. The stdlib files are compiled once per interpreter session and cached by the module loader.

**Consequence**: Users get `import { readFile, writeFile } from "std/fs"` etc. The `lin_*` runtime symbols are not exported from stdlib — they're implementation details behind the clean wrapper API.

## ADR-032: FFI syntax as `import foreign "<path>"` with indented type block

**Decision**: Foreign function imports use `import foreign "<path>"` followed by an indented block of `val name: Type` declarations. The `foreign` keyword is added to the lexer. The parser reuses the existing indented-block machinery. The AST node is `Stmt::ForeignImport { path, bindings: Vec<ForeignBinding> }`. Each `ForeignBinding` carries the name, type annotation, and span.

**Rationale**: Reusing `import` as the outer keyword makes foreign imports visually consistent with regular imports. The `foreign` keyword distinguishes them syntactically without introducing a separate statement form. The indented block mirrors function body parsing (ADR-014) and keeps all bindings visually grouped under the library path.

**Consequence**: `import foreign "libmath.a"\n  val sqrt: (Float64) => Float64` parses correctly. The token `foreign` is now a reserved keyword and cannot be used as an identifier.

## ADR-033: FFI via `import foreign` and LLVM `declare`

**Decision**: The compiler emits an LLVM `declare` for each foreign binding using the C ABI type mapping. Library paths collected from `ForeignImport` nodes are passed to the linker step in `lin-compile`. `import foreign "lin-runtime"` is a special reserved path that is always linked and skips normal FFI type validation.

**Rationale**: LLVM IR's `declare` is the correct mechanism for external C symbol resolution. Keeping library path collection in the AST means `lin-compile` can drive the linker without a separate manifest.

**Consequence**: FFI requires `lin build`. End-to-end FFI tests compile a C library to `.a` and call it from Lin via `lin build`. The type checker validates that all foreign binding types are legal FFI types (numeric, Boolean, Null, or String) at compile time.

## ADR-034: `async` var-capture check via global slot tracking

**Decision**: The type checker rejects `async(f)` and `pool.async(f)` calls where the thunk `f` directly references any mutable `var` binding (either captured from a non-global outer scope, or referencing a global `var` from within the thunk body).

Implementation:
- `Checker` gains a `mutable_global_slots: HashMap<usize, String>` field, populated whenever a `Stmt::Var` is processed at global scope (when `function_scope_depths` is empty).
- `first_mutable_capture(expr, mutable_globals)` checks a `TypedExpr::Function` for: (a) any `Capture` where `is_mutable == true`; (b) any `LocalGet` in the body that references a slot in `mutable_global_slots`. Body scanning does not recurse into nested `Function` nodes (inner lambdas have their own capture check when their own `async` call is analysed).
- In `infer_call`, after building `typed_args`, if `func == Ident("async")`, every thunk argument is checked. Same check on the thunk args of `infer_dot_call` when `method == "async"`.
- The check also registers the concurrency builtins (`async`, `await`, `parallel`, `race`, `timeout`, `retry`, `threadPool`, `worker`) as intrinsics in `register_intrinsics()` using `TypeVar`-based signatures, so they resolve instead of producing "Undefined variable" errors.

**Rationale**: Sharing mutable state across OS threads without synchronisation leads to data races. Lin's `var` is captured by `Rc<RefCell<Value>>` in the interpreter and by pointer in the compiler — neither is `Send`. The spec (§32.2) requires a compile-time error. Global vars are not recorded as "captures" (they're accessed directly via `LocalGet` with slot from global env), so a two-pronged check is needed.

**Consequence**: `async(() => counter = counter + 1)` where `counter` is a `var` produces a compile-time error with a help message suggesting snapshot capture. `async(() => message)` where `message` is a `val` is allowed.

## ADR-035: Match arm narrowing via scope-shadowing

**Decision**: In `check_match_arm`, when the pattern is `Is(TypeCheck(narrowed_ty))` and the scrutinee is a simple `Ident(name)`, the checker defines a new binding `name: narrowed_ty` in the arm's scope. This shadows the outer binding for the duration of the arm body, giving the narrowed type to all references to the scrutinee within that arm.

**Rationale**: Using scope-shadowing instead of mutating the original binding avoids any state-management burden when leaving the arm scope: `pop_scope()` automatically removes the shadow. It also correctly handles nested scopes and captures within the arm body.

**Consequence**: `match x is Int32 => x + 1` correctly type-checks because `x` inside the arm body resolves to the arm-scope `x: Int32`, not the outer `x: Int32 | String`.

## ADR-036: `async(array)` overload

**Decision**: `async` accepts either a single thunk `() => T` or an array of thunks `(() => T)[]`. The array overload spawns one thread per element and returns an array of `Promise` values in input order.

**Rationale**: `await(async([thunk1, thunk2, ...]))` is the natural idiom for fork-join concurrency. Without the array overload, users would need to call `async(thunk)` individually and collect results manually.

**Consequence**: `async([() => fetch(url1), () => fetch(url2)])` spawns two threads and returns two promises in order. `await` on the resulting array blocks until all complete.

## ADR-037: FFI arity checked at compile time

**Decision**: The type checker validates arity and types at every call site to foreign bindings, using the declared `TypeExpr::Function(params, ...)` signature. Arity mismatches are compile-time errors.

**Rationale**: FFI arity errors must be caught early. The type checker has all the information needed and catches them in the same pass as regular function calls.

**Consequence**: `import foreign "lib.a"\n  val add: (Int32, Int32) => Int32\nadd(1)` produces a compile-time arity error rather than a link-time or runtime failure.

## ADR-039: Memory management — deterministic reference counting, cycles are user responsibility

**Decision**: Lin uses deterministic reference counting (RC) for all heap-allocated values (strings, arrays, objects, closures). RC operations are inserted by the compiler; the runtime provides `lin_string_release`, `lin_array_release`, `lin_object_release`, and `lin_closure_release`. Release functions recurse into heap-typed elements/values so that nested structures are freed correctly. Reference cycles between heap objects are **not** detected and will leak — this is a documented limitation.

**Rationale**: RC is deterministic (no GC pauses), predictable, and systems-friendly. The Perceus approach (Reinking et al., PLDI 2021, used in Koka and Lean 4) shows that compile-time linearity analysis can elide most RC operations, making the overhead negligible for common functional-style code. Cycle detection requires either programmer annotations (`Weak<T>`, as in Swift/Rust) or a runtime trial-deletion pass (as in Nim ORC). Both add complexity. Cycles are uncommon in the data pipeline / request handler patterns Lin targets. The tradeoff is acceptable: correctness for acyclic data (the common case), documentation for the cycle edge case.

**Consequence**: Programs must not create reference cycles between long-lived heap objects if they care about memory usage. The typical fix is to break cycles by setting a field to `Null` before the data becomes unreachable. Future work: `Weak<T>` type (Option B) or ORC-style trial deletion (Option C) can be layered on top without changing the base RC contract.

## ADR-038: Optional `else` in `if` expressions — implicit `else null`

**Decision**: The `else` branch of an `if` expression is optional. When omitted, the parser synthesizes `Expr::NullLit` at the `if` expression's span as the implicit else branch. The type checker then unions the then-branch type with `Null`, yielding `T | Null` as the expression's type.

**Rationale**: Side-effect-only patterns like `if cond then push(arr, item)` are idiomatic and common in the stdlib. Requiring `else null` is pure noise in these cases — the intent is clear and the result is always discarded. The `else null` pattern also appeared in predicate-style code (`if found == null && f(item) then found = item else null`) where the explicit null was a placeholder with no meaning. Synthesizing `NullLit` at parse time means the AST shape is unchanged — no `Option<Box<Expr>>` needed in `Expr::If` or anywhere downstream.

**Consequence**: The result type widens to `T | Null` when `else` is absent. Code that uses the result of an `else`-less `if` without handling the `Null` case will pass type-checking silently (the union just grows). This is an acceptable tradeoff: the common case (result discarded) gets cleaner syntax, and the footgun (accidentally using a `T | Null` result as `T`) is the same class of error already present whenever any function returns `Null`.

## ADR-040: Formatter does not preserve comments

**Decision**: The `lin fmt` formatter (`lin-parse/src/formatter.rs`) does not preserve source comments. Comments are stripped by the lexer and are not represented anywhere in the AST. When a file is formatted, all comments are lost.

**Rationale**: Adding comment-preservation would require either (a) threading comment tokens through the AST — significant structural change with no benefit to the compiler — or (b) a separate comment-reattachment pass that heuristically associates comments with nearby AST nodes based on source positions. Both approaches are complex and fragile. The formatter's primary use case (CI canonicality checks, auto-formatting on save) does not require comment preservation. Users who care about comments should commit before formatting.

**Consequence**: Running `lin fmt` on a file that has comments will silently drop them. This is documented behaviour. Future work: a comment-preserving pass that uses `Span` information to reattach comments to the nearest following AST node.

## ADR-041: Default argument values — trailing-comma inversion + per-arity adapters

**Decision**: A parameter may carry a default value (`(a: Int32, b: Int32 = a + 1)`). Optional parameters must be last. Because Lin already gives "supply fewer arguments than declared" a meaning — left-to-right partial application (spec §10.2) — and default values want the *same* call shape to mean "call now, fill the rest from defaults", the two are disambiguated at the call site by an **explicit trailing comma**: `f(x,)` partially applies; `f(x)` is a complete call that fills any omitted trailing defaults (and is an error if an omitted parameter has no default). This inverts the previous rule, where bare under-application curried. `Type::Function` gains a `required: usize` field (count of non-defaulted leading params), excluded from structural compatibility but serialized into module signatures so importers can check arity. Defaults are filled by the **defining** module, not the caller: for a function with optional params, lowering synthesizes one **adapter** per shortfall arity (`f$default{k}`) that binds the omitted parameters to their default expressions and calls the real function. Static calls (direct, dot, imported-by-symbol) route to the adapter by name/id. For the first-class-value path (`val g = f; g(x)`), each default-bearing function gets a static **descriptor** (`{ total, required, entries[] }` of boxed-ABI wrappers) stored at closure offset 32; an indirect under-arity call dispatches through it. The closure struct grew from 32 to 40 bytes (all closures, uniformly, so the runtime frees a single fixed layout); the descriptor is a never-freed static global.

**Rationale**: Synthesizing adapters as `TypedExpr::Function` and lowering them through the normal function path means RC, coercion, and earlier-parameter/chained default references (`(a, b = a + 1, c = b + 1)`) all work for free — defaults are just ordinary expressions evaluated in a scope where the preceding parameters are bound. Filling defaults in the defining module (rather than serializing default *expressions* into `.sig` files for callers to inline) keeps signatures small and makes cross-module defaults work by symbol reference. The trailing-comma marker resolves the currying/default-fill ambiguity at the exact site where intent lives, with zero new tokens. Putting `required` in `Type::Function` but excluding it from compatibility means default-ness never blocks an assignment or argument match — a `(Int32, Int32) => Int32` value is interchangeable whether or not its second parameter had a default.

**Consequence**: Existing code that relied on bare under-application to curry (e.g. `add(10)`) must add a trailing comma (`add(10,)`); within this repo only one example needed migration. The closure ABI change (32→40 bytes) touches every closure allocation site and `lin_closure_release`; all are updated together. A self-recursive *default-fill* tail call cannot use the TCO fast path (it targets a different-arity adapter), so it lowers as an ordinary call. Implementing the indirect path surfaced and fixed a pre-existing bug in the boxed-ABI wrapper: it inferred the Lin return type from the LLVM return kind and treated every pointer return as already-boxed Json, so a function value returning a raw `String`/`Array`/`Object` crashed the indirect caller (which unboxes); the wrapper now takes the real Lin return type and boxes correctly.

## ADR-043: Async concurrency — copy-by-default RC, catchable faults at the thread boundary

**Decision**: Turning the synchronous async stub into real OS-thread concurrency (spec §32) is gated on three model decisions, locked in here (see `docs/ASYNC_DESIGN.md` for the full plan):

1. **RC under threads = Option C (transfer by deep copy) by default, plus two opt-in shared types `Shared<T>` and `Frozen<T>`.** Refcounts stay non-atomic on the single-threaded hot path. Values crossing a thread boundary (a thunk's captured env, and the transferable result returned through a promise) are **deep-copied** so each thread owns a private, disjoint object graph — nothing is shared, so non-atomic RC is sound. The set of boundary-crossing values is exactly the transferable types (JSON-shaped, acyclic, no `Function`/`Iterator`/cycles — already enforced by the checker), so a deep copy is total and bounded. `Shared<T>` (atomic-RC box + `RwLock`, accessor-only, copy in/out) is the escape hatch for shared *mutable* state; `Frozen<T>` (immortal deep-frozen graph, zero-copy lock-free reads via mutation-inference coercion) for shared *read-only* state. Atomic-RC-everywhere (Option A) and dynamic shared-flag RC (Option D) and COW are rejected (§2.3, §2.3.3) — they tax the non-threaded hot path we just optimised.

2. **Catchable faults via a thread-local async-boundary flag.** A runtime fault (`lin_panic`, array OOB, division by zero, non-exhaustive match, null-spread) historically called `std::process::exit(1)` — uncatchable, correct at the top level (spec §19.1). All such sites now route through `crate::fault::runtime_fault(msg)`: inside an async boundary (thread-local depth > 0) it `panic!`s and unwinds to the boundary's `catch_unwind` (becoming an `Error` at `await`, spec §32.2.2); outside, it keeps the `process::exit(1)` behaviour. The spawned thunk runs inside `fault::with_async_boundary`. `lin_exit` (user `exit()`) is unaffected — intentional termination stays a real exit.

3. **`nounwind` is dropped program-wide when the program uses async.** User-emitted Lin functions are marked `nounwind` (sound: value-based errors, frames never unwind) — but a fault inside a thunk now unwinds *through* Lin frames to the boundary, so `nounwind` is unsound for any function reachable from a thunk. We cannot cheaply prove a given function is unreachable from a thunk, so codegen conservatively drops `nounwind` from all user functions whenever the program references any concurrency intrinsic (detected in `lin-compile` by scanning every module's intrinsic map for the `lin_async`/`lin_parallel`/`lin_worker`/… family, which is reachable only through `std/async`). The overwhelmingly common non-async program keeps `nounwind` and its optimisation value (doc §2.4.3 option a).

**Rationale**: The spec's correctness-by-construction guards (`var`-capture ban, transferable-only returns) were designed anticipating threads — they guarantee a thunk shares only immutable, JSON-shaped, acyclic data with its parent, which is exactly what makes Option C's deep copy total and keeps the single-threaded path atomic-free. Catchable faults are the entire point of `async` being Lin's fault-isolation boundary; routing every fault through one helper that branches on a thread-local keeps the top-level `exit` semantics intact while making thunk faults recoverable. The runtime is `panic = "unwind"` (unchanged), so `catch_unwind` works and unwinding crosses the LLVM/Rust boundary; the only requirement is that the Lin frames in between are not `nounwind`, hence decision 3.

**Consequence**: Programs that use async pay a small code-size/optimisation cost (no `nounwind` on user functions) — measured negligible, and zero for non-async programs. Deep-copying large transferable results at a boundary is the cost of Option C; `Shared<T>`/`Frozen<T>` are the escape hatches so we are never forced into all-atomic RC. `Shared<T>` reintroduces deadlock and RC-cycle hazards (documented); `Frozen<T>`'s immortal graphs are never freed (load-once data only). A genuine (non-fault) panic inside a thunk is also caught and surfaced as an `Error` — acceptable, since a runtime bug in a worker should isolate to that worker rather than abort the process. (Implementation note, post-merge with Rust 1.81+: a panic must not unwind out of a plain `extern "C"` runtime fn — the faulting runtime functions and the thunk-call transmutes are `extern "C-unwind"`, and async-reachable Lin frames get `uwtable` so the unwinder can walk through them.)

## ADR-042: All call paths must coerce arguments to parameter types

**Decision**: Every call-lowering path in `lower_call` (`lin-ir/src/lower.rs`) coerces each argument to the callee's declared parameter type via `lower_call_arg` (which boxes a concrete value to `Json`/`TaggedVal*` when the parameter is union/Json) and retains heap arguments via `retain_call_arg`. This includes the fallback **indirect-call path** — a call through a closure *value* (`val f = ...; f(x)`, a closure passed as a parameter, or any non-statically-resolved callee) — which previously lowered its arguments with a bare `lower_expr` and no coercion.

**Rationale**: Lin's uniform closure ABI passes `Json` parameters as boxed `TaggedVal*`. The named-function and imported-function paths already box concrete arguments (an `Array`, `Object`, or scalar) to match a `Json` parameter; the indirect path is just another way to reach the same ABI and must follow the same rule. The callee's parameter types are read from the callee expression's `Type::Function` signature, identically to the other paths.

**Consequence**: Fixes silent data corruption — before this, an `Array` (or any heap value) passed to a `Json`-typed closure parameter reached the callee as a raw `LinArray*` instead of a boxed `TaggedVal*`. The callee read its tag/payload from garbage, so the value behaved as a different (or empty) object and *mutations through it were lost* (e.g. `push` into an accumulator passed to a stored closure left the original array empty). This is the argument-side analog of the return-side boxing bug noted in ADR-041; together they make the first-class-function/closure path representation-correct for all heap types. Regression: `test_array_passed_to_closure_value_mutates` in `crates/lin/tests/integration.rs`.

## ADR-043: Line-leading `[`/`(` is a new statement, not a postfix index/call

**Decision**: Inside an inline lambda body (a `() => ...` body with no `Indent`, parsed by `parse_inline_block`), a `[` or `(` that begins a new source line starts a NEW statement (an array literal, or a parenthesised expression) rather than continuing the previous expression as an index or call. The lexer records, per token, whether a source newline precedes it (`Token::newline_before`) — set in a post-tokenize pass that scans the gap between consecutive token spans — and `parse_postfix_expr` suppresses the `LBracket`/`LParen` postfix arms when `at_line_start()` is true.

**Rationale**: Inside `()`/`[]`/`{}` the lexer suppresses newline tokens entirely (ADR-004), so the parser otherwise has no signal that a `[` opens a new line, and its postfix loop greedily reads `expr \n [ ... ]` as `expr[...]`. This made a line-leading array literal after a statement (the natural way to return a list of values from a multi-statement inline body) silently parse as an index into the preceding expression. The `newline_before` flag recovers the suppressed line break without re-introducing block-structuring newlines into delimited spans. This mirrors the existing post-`Dedent` suppression of postfix `[`/`(` at top-level block boundaries (ADR-011) — same intent, applied where the boundary is a suppressed newline rather than a Dedent.

**Consequence**: `std/test` bodies that do setup then return assertions can use the natural form — `val xs = f(); push(xs, y); [ expect(...).toBe(...) ]` — instead of binding the array to a throwaway `val checks` just to avoid the index-gluing. Same-line indexing (`arr[0]`) and same-line/continuation method chains (`x.map(...)\n  .filter(...)`) are unaffected: the postfix `.` arm is not gated on `at_line_start`, and a same-line `[`/`(` has no preceding newline. Multi-line dot chains assigned through an inline-body `val` (`val r = xs\n  .map(...)`) remain a separate pre-existing inline-body limitation, unchanged by this ADR.

## ADR-044: `Shared<T>` — opt-in shared mutable state (runtime box; type enforcement deferred)

**Decision**: `Shared<T>` (ADR-043 §2.3.1) is implemented as a runtime box: an **atomic**-refcounted `SharedBox` wrapping an `RwLock` over the inner value (stored as a boxed `TaggedVal*`). Four built-ins, exported by `std/async`: `shared(v)` (deep-copy-in, atomic rc=1), `get(s)` (read lock, deep-copy a snapshot out), `set(s, v)` (write lock, deep-copy in), `withLock(s, f)` (write lock held across `f`, which mutates the inner value in place; `f`'s result is deep-copied out). The box is boxed as `TaggedVal*(TAG_SHARED)`; its retain/release route to atomic `lin_shared_retain_box`/`lin_shared_release_box`, and the thread-transfer copy path **shares** it by an atomic bump rather than copying through (the nesting rule). The inner object graph keeps ordinary non-atomic RC — it is only reachable while a lock is held, so all access is serialized.

**Rationale**: This delivers the load-bearing guarantee — real, race-free shared *mutable* state without taxing the single-threaded hot path (only the box's refcount is atomic; only `Shared` operations take a lock). Copy-in/copy-out at every boundary means no live reference into the inner graph escapes the lock, so the inner non-atomic RC is sound. Validated under ASan and a multi-threaded `#[test]` (8 threads × concurrent get/set) plus a Lin-level concurrent-`withLock`-push test (no lost updates).

**Consequence**: The compile-time **accessor-only enforcement** (rejecting `push(s, 7)`, indexing, auto-unwrap on a `Shared<T>` as a type error) is **now wired** (follow-up landed): a dedicated `Type::Shared(Box<Type>)` variant is threaded through the checker, IR, and codegen. `shared`/`get`/`set`/`withLock` are typed against it (`shared: <T>(T) => Shared<T>`, `get: <T>(Shared<T>) => T`, `set: <T>(Shared<T>, T) => Null`, `withLock: <T,R>(Shared<T>, (T)=>R) => R`); the stdlib wrappers annotate `Shared` (resolvable by name, like `Iterator`); and compat makes `Shared<T>` **invariant** — compatible only with another `Shared<U>` (inner types recursed) and explicitly NOT widening to `Json`/`TypeVar`, so it can't silently flow into a `Json` parameter and lose the guard. Any non-accessor op on a `Shared` value is therefore a type error (`Argument 1 has type Shared<…>, expected …`). At runtime it is still a boxed `TaggedVal*(TAG_SHARED)` (`is_union_type` / `is_union_ty` include it; RC dispatches through the tag-aware path; `capture_kind` → `CAP_TAGGED` so the transfer copy path shares it by atomic bump — the nesting rule). NOTE: `lin check` does not resolve imports, so this enforcement is visible under `lin build`/`lin run` (which do); a bare `lin check` still sees imported names as `Json`. Remaining caveats unchanged: `withLock` mutates in place, so a scalar accumulator (`n => n + 1`) does not persist (use a one-element array or `get`/`set`); `set` collides by name with `std/array`'s `set` when both are imported (alias one); `Shared<T>` makes reference cycles reachable and Lin has no cycle collector (ADR-039); `withLock` reintroduces deadlock potential (no reentrancy, keep critical sections short).

## ADR-045: `Frozen<T>` — opt-in shared read-only state via deep immortal seal (coercion deferred)

**Decision**: `Frozen<T>` (ADR-043 §2.3.2) is implemented as a deep, transitive **immortal seal**. `frozen(v)` (runtime `lin_freeze`, exported by `std/async`) walks the transferable graph rooted at `v` and saturates every heap node's refcount to `IMMORTAL_RC` (string/array/object, recursively). The existing immortal guard on strings is extended to arrays and objects: `lin_array_release`/`lin_object_release` and the array/object arms of `retain_tagged_payload` (and `lin_rc_retain`, already guarded) become **no-ops** when a node's refcount is `>= IMMORTAL_RC`. The thread-transfer copy path shares an immortal array/object by reference (zero-copy), never deep-copies through it. `frozen(v)` returns `v` (now frozen) — the value keeps its plain type, so readers use it transparently.

**Rationale**: The trap with shared read-only data is that a read-only function compiled once against `T` does **non-atomic** `retain`/`release` on its parameter; run on N threads sharing one value, those refcount writes race even though the contents are never written. Making the graph immortal turns retain/release into guarded no-ops that only *read* the sentinel — and a race needs a writer, so concurrent reads of the count are race-free. Therefore the read-only function's existing non-atomic RC runs correctly on a shared frozen value **with no recompilation, no lock, and no atomics**. This is the interned-string immortality trick (already shipped) generalized from one string to a whole graph. Validated by a multi-threaded test (a frozen array read concurrently by N threads) under ASan.

**Consequence**: **Immortal ⇒ never freed.** `frozen` is for load-once, program-lifetime reference data (one O(size) seal at startup); a `frozen()` value created-and-discarded in a loop **leaks** — documented in STDLIB.md. The **mutation-inference read-only coercion** (the §2.3.2 rule that lets a `Frozen<T>` be passed to a `T` parameter *iff the callee doesn't mutate it*, rejecting mutating callees at compile time) is **deferred** — it needs a dedicated `Type::Frozen` variant plus an interprocedural per-parameter mutation-inference pass cached in `ModuleSignature`. Today `frozen(v): T` returns the plain type, so reads "just work", but *mutating* a frozen value is not a compile error — the mutation is silently a no-op on the immortal node (and lost) rather than diagnosed. The runtime immortality/zero-copy-share semantics are fully enforced and safe. A frozen graph is acyclic and immutable, so unlike `Shared<T>` it adds no deadlock and no new cycle hazard.

## ADR-046: `Error` built-in type + `is Error`; `await`'s `T | Error` wrapping deferred

**Decision**: `Error` is a built-in type resolving to the structural shape
`{ "type": String, "message": String }` (`resolve.rs::error_type`) — the conventional error
value (spec §19) and the exact object the async runtime builds when a thunk faults
(`{ "type": "error", "message": <msg> }`). `is Error` (and any `is <ObjectShape>`) lowers to a
**field-presence** check (`HasPattern` on the object's keys) rather than a bare tag check, so it
matches error-shaped objects specifically instead of every object. This makes the spec's §32.2.2
pattern work:

```txt
match await(p)
  is Error => print("failed: ${result}")
  else     => use(result)
```

**Rationale**: `Error` has no special control-flow behaviour (§19), so a structural object type is
the faithful model — it composes in unions and narrows by shape. Routing object-shaped `is`
checks through the existing `HasPattern` machinery reuses the same field-presence test as
`is { .. }`, with no new runtime support.

**Consequence (deferred)**: The other half of §32.2.2 — `async` wrapping its result as
`Promise<T | Error>` so the checker **rejects using an uninspected `Error` as a plain `T`** — is
**not implemented**, and is not a localized change. The entire async surface is `Json`-typed
through the stdlib wrappers (`async = (f: Json): Json`, `await = (p: Json): Json`); there is no
parametric `Promise<T>` tracking (there never was — the synchronous stub was `Json`-typed too).
`await(p)` therefore returns `Json`, which coerces freely to any type, so the "reject uninspected
Error" rule cannot be enforced without first making `async`/`await` **generic over the thunk's
return type** — a parametric-opaque-type feature spanning the checker's inference, the intrinsic
signatures, and module signatures. That is its own project; until then `is Error` gives users the
*runtime* discrimination the spec intends, and a fault is always a well-formed `Error` object,
just not statically forced to be handled. Likewise §32.2.3 nested-promise auto-flatten IS now
implemented (runtime: `await` recurses through a `TAG_PROMISE` result).

## ADR-047: Logical `!` as the second unary operator

**Decision**: Add a prefix logical-not operator `!` (e.g. `if !ready`, `match ... when !cond`, `val x = !flag`). It sits at the same precedence level as bitwise `~` — tighter than `*`, looser than postfix — and is right-associative, so `!!x` parses as `!(!x)` and `!a == b` parses as `(!a) == b`. Both its operand and its result are `Bool`. A non-`Bool`, non-`TypeVar` operand is a compile-time error. Negated *patterns* (e.g. `is !true`) are explicitly out of scope.

**Rationale**: The previous spec stated `~` was the only unary operator and that boolean negation had to be written `ready == false`. That boilerplate appeared throughout the stdlib (`std/array`) and user code. `!` removes it. Implementation is cheap because it reuses the existing unary pipeline end-to-end: the lexer emits a new `Bang` token, the AST gains `UnaryOp::Not`, and IR lowering maps `UnaryOp::Not` to the same `crate::ir::UnaryOp::Not` as `~` — for an `i1`, a bitwise-not *is* a logical-not, so codegen's existing `build_not` arm needs no change. When the operand is not statically `Bool` (e.g. a boxed `TypeVar` flowing through a generic lambda), the lowering routes it through `lower_cond_as_bool` first to unbox/coerce to a raw `i1` before the `Unary` instruction.

**Consequence**: This supersedes the prior "the only unary operator is `~`" statement in §3.7, §24.1, and §35.2 of the specification. The language now has exactly two unary operators (`~` bitwise, `!` logical); there is still no unary minus.

## ADR-048: `Json` is a covariant sink — closing the Json→concrete cast hole

**Decision**: `Json` (modelled as `Type::TypeVar(u32::MAX)`, see `types.rs::is_json`) is made a **covariant sink**: anything is assignable *into* `Json` (concrete `T → Json` stays allowed, so `writeJson(value: Json)` and the pervasive "store anything as Json" patterns keep working), but a `Json` *value* is **not** assignable *out* to a fully-concrete **structured object** target — one that (after unfolding `Named` types) is an `Object` with at least one required, non-nullable field. So `val p: Person = readJson(...)` (where `Person = {name: String, age: Int32}`) is now a type error; the value must be decoded via `fromJson` (ADR-047) or narrowed via `is`/`has`. The fix splits the old blanket `(_, TypeVar(_)) | (TypeVar(_), _) => true` arm in `compat.rs` into: (1) `(_, TypeVar(MAX)) => true` (sink), (2) `(TypeVar(MAX), target) => lenient_json || !requires_structured_decode(target)`, (3) the existing permissive arm for all *other* (non-MAX) TypeVars — genuine inference vars, the `9000+` generic slots, intrinsic vars — so inference is unchanged. `requires_structured_decode` deliberately treats only required-field objects as the hazard: `Json` flowing into scalars (`Int32`/`Int64`), buffers (`UInt8[]`), opaque handles, open objects (`{}`), arrays, functions, iterators, or anything still containing a TypeVar stays permissive — those are the language's handle/buffer/polymorphic-return patterns, which have no `fromJson` remedy and predate this change.

**Rationale**: The old rule made `Json` bidirectionally compatible with *everything*, so a value read from a `Json` source could be silently bound to a richly-typed annotation with **zero validation** — the annotation was a lie. Drawing the line at required-field objects catches the real "I claimed this JSON is a `Person`" hazard (the one a decoder can fix) while not breaking the thousands of existing scalar/handle/buffer flows. The leniency is scoped: a per-`Checker` `lenient_json` flag is set **only** for the trusted embedded stdlib (whose wrappers forward `Json` handles into concrete intrinsic/foreign params by design, e.g. `lin_parse_json`, `pathMatch`); user modules and user-defined imported modules always check strictly. After this change the only sound `Json → T` conversions are (a) `fromJson` (validated decode) and (b) `is`/`has` narrowing (a separate `checker/pattern.rs` path that branches on `ty.is_json()` directly and is backed by runtime tag checks, so it stays sound and is unaffected).

**Consequence**: The predicted blast-radius migration sites (`pathMatch`'s `String` params, `lin_parse_json`'s `String` param) did **not** in fact break: their targets are scalars, not required-field objects, so the narrower `requires_structured_decode` rule leaves them permissive — no stdlib widening was needed. The whole stdlib, example suite, and test suite compile unchanged. The scalar/handle escape hatch is a deliberate soundness gap (`Json → Int32` is still unchecked) accepted to avoid a disruptive migration; tightening it later (e.g. a `fromJson` for scalars) is additive. `lin build` of `val p: Person = readJson(...)` (and the direct `val p: Person = jsonReturningCall()` form) now surfaces `Expected type {...}, got ?T4294967295`; the remedy is `Person.fromJson(...)`. (Note: `lin check` of a *single* file leaves imported functions' return types as fresh inference vars rather than `Json`, so the gate cannot fire there for an imported call — the full `lin build` pipeline, which resolves import signatures, is the authority. A bug where a zero-param or all-`Json`-param `Json`-returning function was misclassified as the opaque `Function` annotation — and its `Json` return freshened into a permissive inference var, slipping the gate — was fixed in `infer_call` by requiring the opaque shortcut to have a *non-empty* all-`TypeVar(MAX)` param list.)

**Scope decision — total vs structured (empirically locked)**: a *total* gate (rejecting ANY `Json → concrete T`, including scalars and arrays) was implemented and run against the full suite. It broke (a) the stdlib's pervasive **polymorphic-return idiom** — `slice`/`concat`/`accept`/`wait`/etc. return `Json` and are routinely assigned to concrete `val`s (`val sub: UInt8[] = slice(bytes, 1, 4)`, `val code: Int64 = wait(pid)`, socket `accept(): Int32`) — and (b) **`is`-narrowing into a concrete branch** (`if j is String then j else ""`, whose narrowed value is still statically `Json`). Empirically: `test_is_narrowing_still_works`, `test_slice_preserves_element_type`, `test_net_tcp_loopback_echo`, `test_net_udp_loopback_roundtrip`, `test_proc_spawn_read_wait`, `test_proc_wait_exit_code` all failed under the total gate. These patterns have **no `fromJson` remedy** and forcing one is hostile, so the total scope was rejected and the gate is **scoped to required-field structured objects** — the genuine "unchecked object decode" hazard. This matches the structured-object-only conclusion anticipated in the plan.

## ADR-049: `fromJson` — type-directed JSON decode (descriptor-driven runtime interpreter)

**Decision**: `T.fromJson(json)` (and the equivalent `fromJson(T, json)`) is a **checker special form** that validates a `Json` value against the target type `T` and yields `T | Error`. It is recognised by the surface name `fromJson` at the call site (intercepted in both `infer_call` and `infer_dot_call` *before* arg0/receiver is inferred as a value, since arg0 is a *type*, not a runtime value — so unlike `print`/`for` no `lin_*` wrapper can express it). `std/json` exports a `fromJson` stub purely so the import resolves and `lin check` sees the name; the stub body is never used for real call sites. Validation is implemented as a single generic runtime interpreter `lin_from_json(value, descriptor)` driven by a compact, position-relative byte **descriptor** emitted per call site by codegen (`DescEncoder`), so emitted code is O(1) per site and recursion/cycles are finite back-edges (memoised by named type). The interpreter walks value+descriptor in lockstep, returns the input **cloned** (`lin_tagged_clone`, +1 independently owned) on success or a fresh `Error` on the first structural mismatch, building a JSONPath-ish `path` (e.g. `$.address.city`) during the walk. `Error` is a structural object alias `{ "type": "error", "message": String }` (resolved by `resolve_named_cycle`, not a new `Type` variant — cf. ADR-044), and the runtime error value also carries a `"path"` field, which width subtyping permits.

This ADR records three load-bearing semantic choices and their trade-offs:

- **(a) Union variant selection is FIRST-MATCH-WINS.** A `KIND_UNION` node tries each variant in declaration order and accepts the first that validates. **Trade-off**: for overlapping, non-discriminated object variants the most-permissive / first-listed variant *shadows* more-specific ones — e.g. with `{ "k": String } | { "k": String, "w": Int32 }`, an input that has both `k` and `w` matches the first variant. The *runtime data is fully preserved* (the same value is returned, no fields are dropped), but the *static type* the program reasons about is the matched variant, which may be the wider one. **Recommendation**: give union variants a discriminant field (e.g. a literal `"type"` tag) so exactly one variant matches; list more-specific variants first when overlap is unavoidable. First-match-wins was chosen for v1 because it is predictable, order-explicit, and matches the spec's first-error policy spirit; a "best/most-specific match" rule would be ambiguous and costly.

- **(b) Number policy is target-type-driven.** An **integer** target requires the JSON number to be integral and within the target's width/signedness range (a float like `3.14` is rejected; an integral float like `5000000000.0` against `Int32` is rejected as out of range). A **float** target (`Float32`/`Float64`) accepts any JSON number. An **unconstrained** target (`Json`/a `TypeVar`, encoded as `KIND_JSON`) accepts any number as-is with no narrowing — number-range validation is intentionally skipped there by design. (Note: a bare suffixless integer *literal* in Lin source is typed `Int32` and truncated by the lexer per spec §26 *before* it can reach `fromJson`, so genuine out-of-range integers arriving from real JSON parsing are the cases the range check guards.)

- **(c) `Error` is a structural object alias, but `is Error` IS made to discriminate.** `Error` is `{ "type": String, "message": String }` (open, resolved by `resolve_named_cycle`; the runtime value also carries `"path"`). A *bare* tag check would match any object, so to make the agreed idiom `match result | is Error => .. | is Person => ..` work, **`is Error` is desugared in the checker (`check_pattern`, `Pattern::TypeName == "Error"`) into the value-constrained object pattern `{ "type": "error", "message": _ }`.** This reuses the existing object-pattern lowering (`lower_object_pattern_test`) which checks field presence AND `scrut["type"] == "error"` at runtime — exactly what distinguishes a decode failure (always `"type": "error"`) from a decoded value (any other shape). Standalone `Expr::Is` was routed through the same object-pattern path (its old `IsType` lowering mapped an object pattern to `Type::Never`/tag `0xFF`, which never matched). Exhaustiveness was taught to count this desugared pattern as covering the `Error` union variant. Chosen over adding a dedicated `Type::StrLit` literal-type (which would touch ~20 exhaustive `Type` matches across codegen/boxing/representation — too invasive, cf. ADR-044) and over a new `Type` variant. **Former residual trade-off, now RESOLVED by ADR-050:** when this ADR was written, the standalone expression form `result is Person` compiled to a bare `TAG_OBJECT` check, so it *also* matched the Error object and the `is Error` arm had to come first or a decode failure would route into the `Person` arm and fault on `result["name"]`. ADR-050 makes `is <ObjectType>` check the target's required fields in **both** the match-arm and expression paths, so `is Person` no longer matches an Error object and the arm order is no longer load-bearing. The `result["type"] == "error"` discriminant still works and remains valid for code that prefers it.

**Rationale**: A descriptor + one generic interpreter (validator strategy C) beats inlining per-site LLVM (code bloat, recursion needs emitted helpers) and per-type generated functions (still heavy IR, forward-decl cycle handling): it keeps generated code tiny, reuses the existing tag/unbox runtime primitives, makes recursion trivial (table indices), and makes the walker ordinary, unit-testable Rust. Returning a **clone** rather than the same retained pointer (a deviation from the original plan note) keeps ownership symmetric: the `fromJson` result is registered `+1 owned` in lin-ir, and the input value temp is independently owned and released by normal liveness — returning the *same* pointer would alias two owners and double-free. Verified under AddressSanitizer: no use-after-free / double-free; the decode-`Error` builder (`make_decode_error`) releases its locally-created key/value strings after `lin_object_set` retains them, so error values are leak-clean (only the program-lifetime interned string-literal cache leaks, as elsewhere).

**Consequence**: The input `Json` is **borrowed** (never consumed); the result is unconditionally a fresh `+1`-owned value (clone on success, fresh `Error` on failure); the descriptor is a static const global (never freed). Array/fixed-array/object/union targets can only be named via a `type` alias or built-in name because the special form requires arg0 to be a bare identifier (`Int32[].fromJson(...)` does not parse; use `type IntArr = Int32[]`). A user who shadows `fromJson` with a *local* binding defers to the normal call path; a global user `fromJson` called with a real type-name arg0 would still be intercepted (an accepted, low-risk corner). `Iterator`/`Function`/`Never`/`TypeVar` target fields encode as `KIND_JSON` (accept-any), since they are not JSON-shaped and have no meaningful structural check.

## ADR-050: `is <ObjectType>` checks required fields (in both match-arm and expression forms)

**Decision**: `x is Person` (where `Person` resolves to an object type with at least one field) checks at runtime that `x` is an object **and has all of `Person`'s required field keys present** — not merely that `x` carries the `TAG_OBJECT` tag. This holds uniformly in both lowering paths: the match-arm path (`lower_match_pattern`) already emitted a `HasPattern` field-presence check for `Is(TypeCheck(Object(fields)))`; this ADR adds the *same* arm to the standalone-expression path (`TypedExpr::Is` in `lower.rs`), which previously fell through to a bare `IsType` tag check. An empty object type (`{}`) still degrades to the tag check (nothing to require).

**Rationale**: A bare tag check made `is <ObjectType>` unsound. `is Person` matched *any* object — including a `fromJson` decode error `{ "type": "error", ... }` or an arbitrary `{ "foo": "bar" }`. Because the matched arm then statically **narrows** the binding to `Person`, a subsequent `x["name"]` is typed `String` and compiled through the non-null-safe field path; on an object actually lacking `name`, `lin_object_get` returns null and string interpolation null-derefs (`lin_string_concat`), crashing. The narrowing was a lie the runtime did not enforce. Mirroring `is { .. }` / `has` field-presence checking closes the hole with the existing `HasPattern` → `lin_value_has_field` machinery — no new instruction, no new runtime primitive.

**Consequence**: This **supersedes the ADR-049 arm-ordering rule**: `is Person` no longer matches an `Error` object (an `Error` has `type`/`message`, not `name`/`age`), so `match | is Person => .. | is Error => ..` is now sound in either order. ~~Checking is **field-presence only**, not recursive field-*type* validation: `is Person` on `{ "name": 1, "age": "x" }` (both keys present, wrong value types) still matches~~ **(SUPERSEDED by ADR-053: `is <ObjectType>` now deep-validates field TYPES recursively, so a presence-only-but-wrong-type object no longer matches; see ADR-053 for the why and how — this ADR's presence-rejection is subsumed by the deeper check).** This keeps `is` cheap (one `lin_value_has_field` per required key) and consistent with `has`/`is { .. }`, which are also presence checks. Width subtyping is preserved: extra fields on `x` don't prevent a match. Verified: a real `Person` matches; an object missing a required field does not; the former decode-failure crash is gone; full suite green (278 integration + 6 + 33 + 7 + 24).

## ADR-051: Singleton string-literal types

**Decision**: A string literal in **type** position is a singleton type. `Type::StrLit(String)` is a
new `Type` variant (mirrored by `TypeExpr::StringLit` in the surface AST and parsed in
`parser/types.rs` before the `_` fallback). It admits only the one string value. This makes the
spec §18 tagged union discriminate at compile time:

```txt
type Result<T, E> = { "type": "success", "value": T } | { "type": "failure", "error": E }
val r:   Result<Int32, String> = { "type": "success", "value": 1 }   // OK
val bad: Result<Int32, String> = { "type": "nope",    "value": 1 }   // compile error
```

The guiding principle is **"`StrLit` is `Str` at runtime, a singleton at check-time."** A
`StrLit("x")` value is represented at runtime *identically* to a `String` — same `TAG_STR`/6 tag,
same `string_ptr_type` llvm type, same boxing/unboxing, same refcounting, same `toString`. So
nearly every exhaustive `Type` match in `lin-ir`/`lin-codegen` simply grew a new arm grouped with
`Type::Str` (`Type::Str | Type::StrLit(_)`), and a `StrLit` lowers to an owned `Str` temp. The only
genuinely new logic is at check-time.

**This REVERSES the avoidance of a new `Type` variant that ADR-044/049 chose.** ADR-049 explicitly
rejected "adding a dedicated `Type::StrLit` literal-type (which would touch ~20 exhaustive `Type`
matches across codegen/boxing/representation — too invasive)". That cost was paid here, but the
"`StrLit` = `Str` at runtime" mitigation made it mechanical: each of those ~20 sites does *exactly*
what the `Str` arm does, so there is no new representation, no new runtime primitive, and no new RC
class. The three RC classifiers that must stay in lockstep — `lin-ir::lower::is_rc_type`,
`lin-ir::rc_elide::is_rc_type`, and `lin-codegen::types::ty_is_concrete_rc` — all treat `StrLit`
as a refcounted string, and release routes through `string_release` (retain uses the tag-aware
`lin_rc_retain`, identical to `Str`). Validated under AddressSanitizer: a `String`-typed and a
`StrLit`-typed loop (1000 iterations each, build-and-discard) produce an *identical* leak profile
(4140 bytes / 3 allocations — the program-lifetime interned literal cache, leaked by design as
elsewhere), with **no** use-after-free, double-free, or refcount underflow. The §18 divide/Result
example runs and discriminates both branches cleanly under ASan too.

**Compat rules (`compat.rs`, after the `Shared`/`TypeVar(MAX)` arms, before numeric/union/object)**:
1. `(StrLit a, StrLit b) => a == b` — two singletons compatible iff equal.
2. `(StrLit, Str) => true` — a literal widens to the open `String` type.
3. `(Str, StrLit) => false` — load-bearing rejection: an arbitrary string is not statically known
   to equal the singleton, so `val t: Tag = someString` is an error.
4. The `Json`-sink arms are unchanged; an object with a (non-null) `StrLit` field is already treated
   as "structured" by `requires_structured_decode`, so a `Json` value still cannot be silently
   bound to a literal-discriminated object — it must go through `fromJson` or `is`/`has` narrowing.

**Bidirectional refinement (`checker/expr.rs`)**: a bare string-literal *value* still infers to
`String` (`infer_expr` is unchanged — §33). Narrowing happens only in `check_expr` against an
expected type: (a) `Expr::StringLit` against an expected `StrLit("t")` is accepted iff equal and
yields a `StrLit("t")`-typed node (`TypedExpr::StringLit` gained a `Type` field, normally `Str`);
(b) `Expr::Object` against an expected object/union/named type pushes the expected field types down
per-field, and for a union *selects the variant by matching the discriminant literal*, erroring with
the list of valid tags if none match. To make this reach the §18 `divide` body — an
`if/then/else` returning object literals — the expected return type is now pushed into the function
body (and through `if`/block tail positions), but **only when the declared return type mentions a
`StrLit`**, so all other inference and error messages (e.g. "Function body has type …") are
unchanged. This mirrors the existing array-literal refinement pattern.

**`fromJson` validates the exact literal value (ADR-052).** A `StrLit` field encodes as a
`KIND_STRLIT` descriptor node carrying the expected bytes; the runtime interpreter (`lin_from_json`)
checks the JSON value is a string AND equals the singleton, reporting e.g.
`expected "alpha" at $.kind, got "beta"`. This makes `Result.fromJson(...)` reject a wrong
discriminant tag, so the union's first-match-wins probe discriminates variants by their literal tag
(a `{ "type": "failure", ... }` value fails the `"success"` variant's `KIND_STRLIT` check and falls
through to the `"failure"` variant). Superseded the original v1 `KIND_STRING` placeholder.

**Limitations / scope (deliberate, v1)**:
- **`Json → StrLit` stays permissive (unchecked) in user code.** A `Json` value IS assignable to a
  `StrLit` target (`requires_structured_decode(StrLit)` is false — a literal is scalar-like), exactly
  as `Json → Int32` is unchecked (ADR-048 scalar gap). `fromJson` is the validated path. Tightening
  this would diverge from the scalar-gap policy, so it is left consistent by design.
- **Exhaustiveness (Step F) was NOT implemented.** Recognising a literal-discriminated `has`/`is`
  arm as covering a specific union variant is *not* done. This is safe: the existing exhaustiveness
  checker already requires an `else` (or a covering arm) for *any* object-union `has`-match — literal
  or not — and emits a diagnostic when absent; that behaviour is unchanged and consistent. Adding
  partial literal-coverage recognition risked inconsistency for marginal benefit, so it was skipped
  (the §18 examples use `else`, which always satisfies exhaustiveness).
- **Numeric and boolean literal types are out of scope** — only string literals are singletons.

**Consequence**: `lin build`/`lin run` of a wrong-tag object now reports e.g. *"Object does not
match any variant of …; expected a discriminant tag in [\"failure\", \"success\"]"* at the object's
span; a `String → literal` assignment reports *"Expected type \"ok\", got String"*. Literal tags
survive generic substitution (`Result<Int32, String>` and `Result<String, Int32>` both
discriminate), since `substitute` passes `StrLit` through its `_ => ty.clone()` tail. As with
`lin-check` generally, a single-file `lin check` leaves an imported function's return type as a
fresh inference var, so the strictest checking is via the full `lin build` pipeline. Verified: full
suite green (288 integration + 6 + 33 + 7; stdlib 19 files; examples 22 files), plus the new
`examples/result/main.lin` fixture.

## ADR-052: `fromJson` validates string-literal field values (KIND_STRLIT)

**Decision**: A `Type::StrLit(s)` target field in `fromJson` (ADR-049) encodes as a new descriptor
node `KIND_STRLIT = 10` carrying `{ u16 lit_len, lit_bytes }`. The runtime interpreter
(`lin_from_json`, `lin-runtime/src/decode.rs`) validates the JSON value is a string **and** equals
that exact literal, returning a decode `Error` like `expected "alpha" at $.kind, got "beta"` on
mismatch. This supersedes ADR-051's v1 placeholder, where a `StrLit` field encoded as `KIND_STRING`
(string-ness only, exact value unchecked).

**Rationale**: Without it, `Result.fromJson({ "type": "bogus", ... })` decoded *successfully* —
`KIND_STRING` accepted any string in the discriminant slot, then the union's first-match-wins probe
(ADR-049(a)) selected the first variant regardless of tag. That is exactly the silent mis-decode
`fromJson` exists to prevent. With `KIND_STRLIT`, each union variant's discriminant literal is
checked during the probe, so a `{ "type": "failure", ... }` value fails the `"success"` variant and
correctly falls through to the `"failure"` variant — real, validated discrimination.

**Consequence**: `KIND_STRLIT` is appended to the descriptor opcode set in both the encoder
(`codegen/intrinsics.rs` `DescEncoder::write_node`) and the decoder (`decode.rs`), kept in sync. A
plain `Type::Str` field still encodes as `KIND_STRING` (accepts any string), so only literal-typed
fields gain value-checking — no change to ordinary string decoding. The encoder memo already keys
`StrLit("a")` and `Str` distinctly (their `Display` differs: `"a"` vs `String`), so shared/recursive
nodes are unaffected. Verified: a wrong discriminant tag is rejected with a path-located message,
correct tags decode and discriminate, plain `String` fields are unchanged, full suite green.

## ADR-053: Imported types usable in type position

**Decision**: An `export type Foo = ...` declaration can be imported (`import { Foo } from "m"`,
including `Foo as Bar` aliases) and used in a type annotation in the importing module. Spec §20.3
always promised this ("Types may be imported with the same syntax"), but it was never implemented:
type exports were dropped at the module boundary, so a use-site hit *"Unknown type 'Foo'"*.

**Why it was missing**: a `type` decl produces no runtime code, so the checker resolved it into its
local `TypeEnv::type_decls` and then returned `TypedStmt::Expr(NullLit)` — it left no trace in the
`TypedModule`. `ModuleSignature::from_module` only scanned `TypedStmt::Val`, so the dependent
module's checker (which is seeded from the signature via the `import_types` map) never learned the
name. Value imports worked; type imports silently didn't.

**Mechanism**: mirror the value path one level up, as *module metadata* rather than a statement.
- `TypedModule` gains `exported_types: HashMap<String, (Vec<String>, Type)>` (params + resolved
  body), populated in `check_module` from each `export type` via `env.lookup_type` — alongside the
  existing `intrinsics` metadata map. It is **not** a `TypedStmt`, so `lin-ir` lowering, codegen,
  liveness, and rc_elide are entirely unaffected (they never see it).
- `ModuleSignature` gains `type_exports` (copied from `exported_types`), so dependents that only
  load the `.sig` still get types. Both new fields are `#[serde(default)]`, so stale `.typed`/`.sig`
  caches deserialize as empty and trigger a graceful re-check rather than an error.
- `Checker` gains an `import_type_decls: (module, name) -> (params, body)` input (the type-level
  analogue of `import_types`). `lin-compile` populates it from each import's `type_exports`.
- A new `register_imported_types` pre-pass (run before `forward_declare_types`, since
  forward-declared signatures may annotate with imported types) walks the `Import` stmts and, for
  each binding matching `import_type_decls`, calls `env.define_type(local_name, params, body)`
  honouring `as` aliases.

The body stored is the **fully resolved** type (Named cycle points preserved), so no cross-module
type-env lookup is needed at the use site — it resolves like a local `type` alias. Generic exported
types work because the stored `params` flow through the same `substitute` path as local generics.

**Scope/limits**: registration is scoped to what is imported — referencing `Foo` without importing
it is still *"Unknown type"* (verified by `test_imported_type_unknown_without_import`). Verified:
the web-server example now does `import { HttpRequest as Request, HttpResponse as Response } from
"std/http"` (its local `Request`/`Response` aliases deleted); full suite green; imported types
round-trip through both cold and warm module caches.

## ADR-054: `is <ObjectType>` deep type validation

**Decision**: `x is <Name>` (where `Name` resolves to a non-empty object type, e.g.
`Person = { "name": String, "age": Int32 }`) validates field **types recursively** at runtime, not
merely that the fields are present (ADR-050). The match succeeds only when `x` genuinely conforms to
the target type — so the binding narrowing the matched arm performs is **sound**. The deep walk is
the *same* operation as `fromJson`'s structural validator (ADR-049): it is **reused, not
duplicated**. A new runtime entry point `lin_matches_schema(value, descriptor) -> u8` runs the
existing `validate` walker (`lin-runtime/src/decode.rs`) and returns a bool (`{ let d = Desc { base:
desc }; let mut p = String::new(); validate(value, &d, 0, &mut p).is_ok() as u8 }`); the mismatch
error string is discarded on the cold path. This inherits fromJson's number policy verbatim
(`KIND_INT` integral + width/sign range, `KIND_FLOAT` any number, `KIND_STRLIT` exact value,
`KIND_OBJECT` recursive, `KIND_ARRAY`/`KIND_FIXED`/`KIND_UNION` as in ADR-049) — exactly the
consistent, sound semantics wanted.

**This reverses ADR-050's presence-only note.** ADR-050 left it explicit that `is Person` on
`{ "name": 1, "age": "x" }` (keys present, wrong value types) still matched, deferring full
type validation to `fromJson`. That residual unsoundness is what this ADR closes: such a value now
falls through, so a subsequent `x["age"] + 1` never operates on a string. ADR-050's presence
rejection is *subsumed* — a missing field still fails (the `KIND_OBJECT` walk reports the missing
required field), and now a present-but-wrong-typed field fails too.

**Wiring** (mirrors `Intrinsic::FromJson { target, named_defs }`):
- **Checker** (`checker/pattern.rs`): `check_pattern` for `Pattern::TypeName` whose resolved type is
  a non-empty `Type::Object` now produces a **new typed-pattern variant**
  `TypedPattern::TypeCheckDeep(Type, Vec<(String, Type)>, Span)` carrying the object type plus the
  resolved bodies of every reachable `Named` type (via the existing `collect_named_defs` helper,
  promoted to `pub(crate)`) so IR lowering — which has no type environment — can build the
  (possibly recursive) schema descriptor. Plain primitives, unions, and non-object named types keep
  the bare `TypeCheck` (and its `IsType` tag check); `is Error` keeps its value-constrained object
  pattern (`error_discriminant_pattern`); empty object types `{}` keep `TypeCheck` (bare tag check).
- **A new variant, not a field on `TypeCheck`, was chosen.** `TypeCheck(Type, Span)` is matched in
  ~8 places; adding a field touches all of them invasively. The variant localizes the change: the
  sites that needed updating just treat `TypeCheckDeep` like `TypeCheck` — narrowing
  (`checker/pattern.rs`, narrow to the carried `Type`), zonking (`zonk.rs`, zonk the `Type` and the
  `named_defs` bodies), exhaustiveness (`exhaustiveness.rs`, count it as covering its variant),
  and the IR pattern helpers `pattern_type_check` / `pattern_elem_type` / the no-binding arm in
  `lower.rs`. Only the two `is <ObjectType>` emit sites diverge.
- **IR** (`lin-ir/src/ir.rs`, `lower.rs`, `liveness.rs`): a new instruction `MatchesSchema { dst,
  val, target, named_defs }` (payload mirrors `FromJson`). The two former `is <ObjectType>` sites —
  the standalone `TypedExpr::Is` arm and `lower_match_pattern`'s
  `Is(TypeCheckDeep(..))` — now emit `MatchesSchema` instead of `HasPattern`. `val` is the
  already-boxed-to-Json scrutinee, exactly as the `HasPattern` path boxed it (`box_to_json`);
  liveness treats it as `(uses val, defs dst)`.
- **Codegen** (`codegen/match.rs`, `mod.rs`): `MatchesSchema` reuses `emit_from_json_descriptor`
  (promoted to `pub(crate)`) to emit the same static descriptor global the `FromJson` path builds,
  then calls `lin_matches_schema(val, desc)` and truncates the returned `i8` to a bool. Branchless,
  single basic block — composes inside match-arm test blocks like `compile_ir_has_pattern`.

**RC/memory**: `lin_matches_schema` **borrows** `value` (no clone, no release) and reads a static
const descriptor — no ownership change, low risk. The input value temp's ownership is unchanged from
the `HasPattern` path; the `box_to_json` boxing is still done before `MatchesSchema`.

**Unchanged behavior** (verified): `has { .. }` and inline `is { .. }` object patterns stay
presence + value-constraint (`lower_object_pattern_test`); `is Error` stays the value-constrained
object pattern and still discriminates a decode failure from a decoded value in either arm order;
empty object types `{}` keep the bare tag check; all `fromJson`, async/await `Error`, and
literal-type/union tests stay green.

**Consequence**: `is <ObjectType>` narrowing is now sound — the runtime enforces what the type
narrowing claims. Recursive types (`type Tree = { "value": Int32, "children": Tree[] }`) terminate
because `collect_named_defs` is bounded by a `seen` set and the descriptor encoder memoises Named
nodes as finite back-edges. Number policy is consistent with `fromJson`: `is { "n": Int32 }` rejects
`3.14` (non-integral) and accepts `5.0` (integral). Verified end-to-end via `lin build`: deep
rejection of a wrong (incl. nested) field type, a valid value matching with sound narrowed field
access (`v["age"] + 1` = correct number), `is Error` still discriminating, and recursive `Tree`
validation. Full suite green (302 integration + 6 + 33 + 29 + 7; 42 stdlib/examples test files).

## ADR-055: `std/proc` consolidated into `std/process` (batch + streaming)

**Decision**: There were two documented subprocess modules — a working low-level `std/proc`
(`spawn(argv)` → `Int64`, `readStdout`, `wait` → exit code) and an unimplemented high-level
`std/process` (`exec`/`shell`/`cwd`/`chdir`, `spawn(command,args)`, `wait` → `ExecResult`). They
are merged into a single `std/process` exposing **both** styles:
- **Batch**: `exec(command, args)` / `shell(command)` run to completion and return an
  `ExecResult { status, stdout, stderr }`; `cwd()` / `chdir(path)`.
- **Streaming**: `spawn(command, args)` → opaque `ProcessHandle` (`Int64`); `readStdout(handle, buf)`
  reads the piped stdout incrementally; `kill`; `wait` → exit code (`Int32`).

**Why both, and why `wait` stays exit-code**: streaming and batch don't compose on one handle —
`readStdout` drains the pipe, so a `wait` that returned full stdout (as the doc'd `std/process.wait`
implied) would come back empty. Rather than maintain two registries or silently break streaming, the
batch path (`exec`/`shell`) owns "collect all output", and the streaming `wait` returns just the exit
code. `spawn`/`exec` both take `(command, args)` (the doc'd `std/process` shape); the old argv-array
`spawn(["sh", ...])` form is gone.

**Mechanism**: runtime `crates/lin-runtime/src/proc.rs` → `process.rs`, intrinsics renamed
`lin_proc_*` → `lin_process_*`, adding `lin_process_{exec,shell,cwd,chdir}` (the batch fns build an
`ExecResult` object / run `Command::output()`). Streaming fns keep the monotonic-id `Child` registry
unchanged. `stdlib/proc.lin` → `process.lin`, embedded as `"std/process"` in `lin-compile`. The
stdlib wrappers dogfood ADR-053 (imported types): `ExecResult` is an exported record type and
`ProcessHandle` an exported `Int64` alias, used in the wrapper signatures.

**RC/memory**: `make_exec_result` follows the leak-clean object-build pattern (`fs::make_decode_error`)
— `lin_object_set` retains the key and the value's inner string, so the local `+1` from each
`make_string` is released afterward; the object becomes sole owner and freeing the returned box frees
everything. (The older `make_response_object`/`make_error_obj` skip this; they are program-lifetime
singletons so it never mattered, but `exec` is called repeatedly.) Verified leak-free under
LeakSanitizer (the only residual reports are pre-existing program-lifetime interned string literals).

**Migration**: the lone consumer (`examples/processes`) and the proc tests were updated to the new
`spawn(command, args)` form and `std/process` import. Verified: stdlib + example suites green; three
integration tests (`test_process_spawn_read_wait`, `test_process_wait_exit_code`,
`test_process_exec_and_shell_batch`) pass.

## ADR-056: OS resources are opaque integer fd handles

**Decision**: Operating-system resources exposed by `std/net`, `std/process`, and `std/time`
(timers) are represented to Lin code as **opaque integer handles**, never as runtime object values. A
socket fd is an `Int32` (`udpBind`/`tcpListen`/`tcpAccept`/`tcpConnect` return `Int32 | Error`); a
subprocess handle is an `Int64` (`std/process.spawn` returns a `ProcessHandle`, an exported `Int64`
alias — ADR-055). The integer is meaningful only to the runtime, which keeps the real `fd`/`Child` in
a side table keyed by the integer; user code passes it back to the relevant intrinsic
(`udpRecv(fd, …)`, `wait(handle)`, …). See spec §35.4–§35.6.

**Rationale**: This upholds the §33.1 "no hidden open-handle values" convention already used for
stdin/stdout/filesystem — there is no `Socket` or `Process` object kind to add to the runtime, no new
boxing, and no lifetime/RC story for OS handles. An integer is transferable, comparable, and trivially
representable. Fallible operations return the `T | Error` shape (§33.1); a non-blocking read with no
data yet returns `Null` (not `Error`), so poll loops read naturally (`recv`/`accept` →
`Int32 | Null | Error`).

**Consequence**: No new runtime *kind* is introduced for sockets/processes — they reuse the existing
integer representation (a typed alias like `ProcessHandle` is just `Int64` for readability, not a
distinct kind). The cost is that handles are not type-distinct from ordinary integers; misuse (passing
the wrong integer) is not caught by the type system, consistent with the deliberately-unsafe nature of
the low-level layer. The `Int32`/`Int64` split is pragmatic: fds fit in 32 bits, process handles use 64
to match the platform child representation.

## ADR-057: Share-nothing concurrency — no Mutex/atomics primitive

**Decision**: Lin provides **no** shared-memory concurrency primitives (mutexes, atomics,
cross-thread shared mutable cells). Cross-thread mutable state is modelled exclusively with a
`Worker<Msg, Reply>` (§32.6) that owns the state and serialises all access through its single-threaded
message queue. Spec §35.9 records this as a deliberate absence.

**Rationale**: The concurrency model is share-nothing (§32): `async` thunks and `parallel` may not
capture `var` bindings (compile-time error, ADR-034), and transferred values must be JSON-compatible. A
`Worker` owning its state and processing messages one at a time preserves that invariant — there is no
concurrent access to the worker's closed-over `var`, so no data race is possible without ever
introducing a lock. Adding a `Mutex`/atomic primitive would reintroduce exactly the data-race surface
the model is designed to exclude, and would need a new opaque runtime kind plus a poisoning/lifetime
story.

**Consequence**: Patterns that would use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` in Rust (a shared counter, a connection pool,
a discovered-peer-address cache) are expressed as a `Worker` whose `onMessage` handler closes over the
state (§32.6.4). This is more message-passing boilerplate than a shared cell, accepted as the price of
guaranteed freedom from data races. Single-threaded mutation via `var` is unaffected; the restriction
applies only across thread boundaries.

## ADR-058: Flat unboxed arrays for scalar element types

**Decision**: An array whose element type is a fixed-width scalar — `Int8`/`Int16`/`Int32`/`Int64`,
`UInt8`/`UInt16`/`UInt32`/`UInt64`, `Float32`/`Float64` — is stored as a **packed, unboxed,
contiguous buffer** (one element-width slot per element, no per-element tag), not as an array of boxed
`TaggedVal`s. The runtime provides a flat variant per family
(`lin_flat_array_alloc_{i8,i16,i32,i64,u8,u16,u32,u64,f32,f64}` and matching push/index). A `UInt8[]`
is therefore a literal byte buffer (spec §35.1). Semantically these remain ordinary `T[]` arrays —
every array operation (literals, indexing, in-place write, `length`, `push`, `slice`, `concat`, `==`,
the `std/array` combinators) works identically; the representation is an implementation detail.

**Rationale**: Byte/scalar buffers are the substrate for binary protocols, `std/bytes`, and socket
I/O (`recv` fills a caller-owned `UInt8[]`). Boxing each byte as a tagged value would cost ~16× the
memory and defeat the point. Because the element type is statically known, codegen selects the flat
representation with no runtime tag dispatch. Mixed/`Json`/object arrays keep the boxed tagged
representation; only statically-scalar element types go flat.

**Consequence**: Codegen and the runtime must convert between flat and tagged forms at boundaries where
a flat array meets a `Json`/dynamic context (`lin_flat_to_tagged_*`, used e.g. by `toString` and
dynamic length). The flat/boxed distinction is why `concat`/`slice` are flat-representation-aware:
slicing/concatenating a `UInt8[]` yields a `UInt8[]` whose elements read correctly, not a boxed array
of zeros. `is_flat_scalar` (codegen) is the single predicate deciding the representation and must stay
consistent with the runtime's family set.

## ADR-059: Two unary operators — bitwise `~` and logical `!`; no unary minus

**Decision**: Lin has exactly **two** prefix unary operators: bitwise complement `~` (§35.2) and
logical not `!` (§24.1). There is **no unary minus** — a leading `-` is part of a numeric literal in
literal position (§3.7), and negating a computed value is written `0 - x`. Both unary operators are
right-associative and bind tighter than `*` but looser than postfix call/index/dot (§24.2).

**Rationale**: This supersedes the original v1 design (recorded in earlier drafts and TODO) of `~` as
the *single* sanctioned unary operator. `!` was added (ADR-047) because boolean negation otherwise had
to be spelled `x == false`, pervasive boilerplate in stdlib and user code; it reuses the existing unary
pipeline end-to-end (lexer `Bang` token, `UnaryOp::Not`, and for an `i1` a bitwise-not *is* a
logical-not, so codegen's `build_not` needs no new arm). Unary minus is still excluded: it would
complicate the negative-literal lexing rule (§3.7) for marginal benefit, and `0 - x` is unambiguous.

**Consequence**: Typing rules differ by operator — `~x` requires an integer and yields that integer
type; `!x` requires `Bool` and yields `Bool`; a float operand to `~` (or a non-`Bool` to `!`) is a
compile-time error. The spec's older "the only unary operator is `~`" / "no unary operators in v1"
statements (§24.1, §35.2, decision-list #9) are updated to "exactly two unary operators (`~`, `!`); no
unary minus".

## ADR-060: Closures OWN their captures (retain on capture, release on free)

**Decision**: A closure's environment now OWNS one reference per heap/union capture — the same ownership rule arrays and objects already follow for stored elements. At `MakeClosure` the lowerer takes ownership of each capturing value (concrete rc → `Retain` in place; union/`Json` → `CloneBox` so the env holds its own `TaggedVal*`); `lin_closure_release` releases them when the closure is freed. Mutably-captured `var` bindings are unchanged: they store the heap **cell pointer** (shared by reference, ADR-015) and keep their existing borrow-only / `FreeCell` / escaping-cell lifecycle — the env does not own the cell. Scalars need no ownership.

To let the runtime release captures, every closure carries a **capture descriptor** at closure offset 40 (`{ u32 count, u8 kinds[count] }`, a static read-only global): one `CaptureRelease` byte per capture (None / Str / Array / Object / Closure / Tagged). The closure struct grew from 40 to 48 bytes (`CLOSURE_SIZE`); `alloc_closure`/`store_capture_descriptor` centralise the layout, and `lin_closure_release` frees 48 and walks the descriptor (mirroring the recursive element release in `lin_array_release`/`lin_object_release`). Partial-application closures keep borrow semantics with a null capture descriptor. The async thread-transfer path (ADR-042) reads the same descriptor (passed explicitly from the closure, no longer stored at env offset 0) and reuses its codes.

**Rationale**: Captures were **borrow-only** — the env stored a borrowed pointer with no retain, and `lin_closure_release` freed nothing. That is sound only while a closure cannot outlive its captured values' scope. The `safe_callback_depth`/escaping-cell analysis covered that for mutable `var` cells, but immutable value captures had no ownership at all, so a closure that ESCAPES (e.g. returned from a `map`/`filter` callback into the result array) dangled: `map(xs, i => () => i)` then called a thunk returned garbage (`[[object]…]`) because the captured element box had been freed at end-of-iteration and its memory reused. Making the env an owning container, exactly like arrays/objects, fixes this uniformly and reuses the existing store-side discipline (`transfer_into_container` / `own_for_store`).

**Consequence**: `map(xs, i => () => i)` and any escaping capturing closure are now correct. **Performance is unchanged**: the added retain/release pairs are elided by the existing RC-elision pass for the overwhelmingly common non-escaping combinator-callback case (closures created and consumed in one scope) — a before/after benchmark (`benchmarks/closures.lin`, capturing `map`/`filter`/`reduce` over 2M elements) showed no measurable difference, and the full benchmark suite was flat. The cost lands only on closures that genuinely escape, where it is required for correctness. The closure struct is 8 bytes larger (40→48); `CLOSURE_SIZE` in `lin-codegen/src/codegen/call.rs` and the free size in `lin-runtime/src/memory.rs` must stay in lockstep. Verified under ASan (stdlib + every example-project test suite — heavy closure users — show no use-after-free or double-free; the only leak is the pre-existing exit-time top-level-`val` leak, identical for non-capturing `map`).

## ADR-061: Numeric literal suffixes honoured; large bare literals widen, never truncate

**Decision**: Two related fixes to integer-literal typing, both making the implementation match spec §3.6/§26:
1. **Type suffixes are honoured.** `42i8`, `5u64`, `3.14f32` etc. now pin the literal's type, overriding context/default. Previously the lexer recognised the suffix characters but *discarded* them ("we just consume them"), so `1705314600000i64` was an indistinguishable bare `IntLit` that defaulted to `Int32` and **silently truncated** to its low 32 bits (`212583488`).
2. **A bare literal beyond `Int32` widens its default instead of truncating.** With no surrounding context, a suffixless integer literal still defaults to `Int32` when it fits; when it exceeds `Int32`'s range it defaults to the smallest type that *preserves* the value (`Int64`, or `UInt64` for a decimal above `i64::MAX`). It is never silently truncated.

**Why widen rather than error.** An earlier attempt made an out-of-range bare literal a compile error ("annotate or suffix it"). That broke ergonomic, previously-working code: call arguments are inferred context-free first and *then* re-typed to the parameter width (`checker/call.rs`), so `format(1705314600000, …)` (an `Int64` param) legitimately relies on the literal surviving inference. Widening the default preserves the value for that downstream re-typing while still fixing the truncation; a genuinely-too-big-for-any-type case can't arise (the lexer already maps `> i64::MAX` decimals to the `UInt64` bit pattern). A literal assigned where an *incompatible* concrete type is required (e.g. `val x: Int32 = 5i64`, or `[256]: UInt8[]`) is still a hard error — that path was already range-checked and is unchanged.

**Mechanism**: a shared `NumSuffix` enum in `lin-common` is parsed by the lexer and carried on `TokenKind::IntLit`/`FloatLit` → surface `Expr::IntLit`/`FloatLit` (the typed IR already carries a resolved `Type`, so the suffix stops at the checker). `checker/helpers.rs` gains `suffix_to_type`, `default_int_literal_type` (the Int32→Int64→UInt64 widening ladder), and `check_int_literal_fits` (extracted from the old inline range check). `check_expr` keeps context-typing for suffixless literals; a suffixed literal flows through `infer_expr` (typed at its suffix type) and the normal compatibility tail validates it against the expected type. The formatter round-trips suffixes.

**Consequence**: `1705314600000i64` and `val ts: Int64 = 1705314600000` and a bare `1705314600000` all preserve the value; `val x: Int32 = 5i64` is a type error; small suffixed literals (`200u8`) type at their width. Covered by `stdlib/number.test.lin` (suffix preservation + arithmetic round-trip) and integration tests (`test_i64_suffix_preserves_large_literal`, `test_int64_annotation_preserves_large_literal`, `test_bare_literal_overflowing_int32_preserved`, `test_suffix_overrides_expected_context_conflict`). Full suite green; surfaced and fixed during the `std/time` work, where `format(<ms>, …)` first exposed the truncation.
## ADR-062: `append`/`prepend`/`groupBy` runtime intrinsics — representation-preserving, RC-self-contained

**Decision**: `std/array`'s `append`, `prepend`, and `groupBy` are backed by runtime intrinsics
rather than pure-Lin loops: `lin_array_append_dyn(arr, item)` / `lin_array_prepend_dyn(arr, item)`
(in `array.rs`) and `lin_object_get_or_insert_array(obj, key)` (in `object.rs`). All three are
ordinary `import foreign "lin-runtime"` symbols (ADR-009), needing no special codegen dispatch —
they mirror `lin_array_concat_dyn`'s wiring exactly.

`append`/`prepend` allocate a result that **preserves the input's element representation**
(ADR-058): a flat scalar source (`UInt8[]`, `Int32[]`, …) yields a flat result of the same
`elem_tag` — the item is coerced into the element type via `lin_push_dyn`, the source bytes are
bulk-copied via the per-type flat `concat_into` — while a tagged/`Json[]` source yields a tagged
result. This fixes a latent bug in the old Lin implementation, which used `lin_array_allocate` (a
*tagged* array) + a `.for` copy loop, so appending to a flat `UInt8[]` silently produced a tagged
array of boxed 16-byte elements — element access worked but byte-level consumers (`u32FromBe`, fs
writes, FFI) read garbage (the same class as the pre-fix `concat` bug).

**Rationale for hand-rolling append/prepend instead of composing on `concat_dyn`**: `concat_dyn`'s
tagged path copies element pointers *without* retaining them (`lin_array_push_tagged`) — it relies
on a steal-the-reference discipline at the call boundary and is **not** RC-self-contained (a
growing-accumulator `acc = concat(acc, [freshString])` loop corrupts the heap once the previous
`acc` is released, because the new array's aliased string pointers were never retained; interned
literals merely mask it via their saturated refcount). Composing append on `concat_dyn` and then
freeing the temporary singleton would therefore double-free. The intrinsics instead copy each
tagged element through `lin_push_dyn`, which **retains** the inner payload, and likewise retain the
item — so the returned array owns its own +1 for every heap element and can be released
independently of the borrowed `arr`/`item` with no over- or under-release.

**`get_or_insert` ownership model**: `lin_object_get_or_insert_array` does a *single* hash lookup.
The group array always lives **inside** the object (the object owns it). On the present-and-array
path it retains that interior array (+1) and boxes it; on the absent path it allocates a fresh
array, inserts it via `lin_object_set` (which retains → object owns its ref), drops the
construction +1, then bumps once for the returned box. Either way the returned `Json`
(`TaggedVal*(Array)`) is an owned +1 like every other foreign `Json` result — its scope-exit
release brings the count back down, leaving the object's reference intact. The caller `push`es
into the returned box, which mutates the interior array **in place** (`push` borrows its array arg;
it neither retains nor replaces it), so the new element is visible through the object. `groupBy` is
thereby one lookup + push per item instead of get-then-`null`-check-then-set (two lookups).

**Consequence**: These are perf wins plus a correctness fix (flat preservation for append/prepend).
The RC discipline is the bug-class `cargo test` cannot catch (ADR/feedback on UAF/double-free), so
the intrinsics carry dedicated AddressSanitizer-verified unit tests in `array.rs`/`object.rs`
(build+release intermediates in a loop; a missing retain surfaces as a UAF, a missing release as a
leak). Note `concat_dyn`'s own no-retain tagged path remains a latent defect (out of scope here);
append/prepend deliberately do **not** inherit it.

## ADR-063: Cross-module generic instantiation materializes in the IMPORTING module

**Decision**: A generic `val` function (`<T>(x: T): T => x`) defined in an IMPORTED module is monomorphized in the **importing** module's lowering, not the defining one. `lin-compile` threads the already-typed `imported_modules` map into `lower_module_with_imports` → `monomorphize_with_imports`. The pass discovers a call to an imported generic (the importer's `ImportSlot.ty` is a `Function` with a generic TypeVar in its **parameters** — a return-only TypeVar, as on stdlib intrinsic wrappers like `iter: (…) => Iterator<T>`, does NOT count), clones the generic body out of the imported `TypedModule`, substitutes its quantified TypeVars at the concrete call instantiation, **re-homes** the body into the importer, and emits it as a local specialization (`id$Int32`) that the call is rerouted to.

Re-homing (`rehome_imported_body`) rewrites the cloned body's slots: every body-local slot (params, inner `val`/`var`, destructure targets) is remapped to a fresh importer slot (so it can't collide with the importer's own slots or another specialization), and every FREE reference to the origin module's scope is rewritten into an importer-side construct the importer's lowering already resolves — a sibling function/val → a synthesised `TypedStmt::Import` (a `Named` call to `{origin_key}_{name}`), an intrinsic → a merged intrinsic slot, a **thin intrinsic wrapper** (`for = (it,f) => lin_for(it,f)`) → the intrinsic itself (inlined, preserving the polymorphic builtin's concrete-element dispatch), a foreign binding → a `ForeignImport`. An import-of-import resolves to the SOURCE module's symbol, never the intermediate's. Imported modules also monomorphize their OWN sibling generic calls during `lower_import_module` (`monomorphize_import`), keeping ALL generic originals so external importers that don't specialize still resolve the boxed `{module_key}_{name}` symbol.

Two supporting fixes: (1) `subst_expr` now substitutes the declared-type field of statements inside a block (`subst_stmt_types`) — a `var acc: U` in a generic body otherwise kept `ty: TypeVar(U)`, producing a boxed-union cell while the substituted closure that captures it read the concrete type (a misaligned-pointer crash). (2) the checker's `infer_function_with_hints` now surfaces a lambda's CONCRETE body type when the expected return is a quantified generic param (id ≥ 9001), so a higher-order generic call (`mymap(arr, x => x*2)` with `f: (T) => U`) can bind `U` from the lambda body; the bare-TypeVar boxing convention is retained for the Json/`Function` polymorphic-slot case.

**Rationale**: The importer has the full `TypedModule` for every import (not just the signature), so it can see imported generic BODIES — the only place with both the body and the concrete call types. Specializing there avoids touching the imported module's compilation/caching and avoids cross-contamination (each importer derives its own specializations from the cached generic body; the `.lin-cache` stores the TypedModule with the generic body intact, keyed by source hash regardless of how importers instantiate). The no-op invariant is preserved: `module_uses_generic` gates the whole pass, so a module that neither defines nor imports a param-generic function lowers byte-for-byte as before (verified: `benchmarks/array_pipeline.lin` IR is byte-identical to baseline).

**Consequence**: User-defined cross-module generics — including higher-order ones with the `map` shape (`<T,U>(arr: T[], f: (T) => U)`) — specialize to native, unboxed code in the importer (e.g. `id$Int32` is `define i32 @"id$Int32"(i32)`). Verified end-to-end (output + IR proof + ASan, no UAF/leak) and across the cache (two importers using one imported generic at different element types each get correct specializations). **Converting stdlib `map`/`filter`/`reduce` to generic was attempted and DEFERRED**: the specialized bodies are themselves nearly box-free, but (a) the result of a `[]`-plus-`push` build is a *tagged* array while a static `U[]` result type makes consumers read via the *flat* ABI — a representation mismatch — and (b) the per-element boxing at the `lin_for` callback boundary remains (the closure ABI passes a `TaggedVal*`), so the static box count rose and ~20 of the diverse stdlib/example uses regressed. The full flat/zero-box pipeline needs closure-callback ABI specialization, which is the next increment. stdlib `array.lin` is therefore left `Json`-typed; the cross-module infrastructure is in place for when that lands.

## ADR-064: `concat` retains copied elements (move-vs-retain split in array element copy)

**Decision**: When `lin_array_concat_dyn` copies elements from a **borrowed** source array (the
tagged-element path, `elem_tag == 0xFF`), it now **retains** each element's heap payload via the new
`lin_array_concat_into_retaining`, so the result array and the source array are independent owners.
The non-retaining `lin_array_concat_into` (a raw 16-byte `TaggedVal` move, no retain) is **kept** and
used only where the source is a fresh temp whose ownership is transferred — `concat_dyn`'s
widened-flat path, where `lin_flat_to_tagged_*` boxes raw scalars at `+1` and the temp array is then
`lin_array_free`d (which frees only the struct + buffer, never the element payloads, so the boxes are
correctly *moved* into the result).

**Rationale**: The old `concat_dyn` used the move-copy (`lin_array_push_tagged`, raw 16-byte copy
without retain) for **every** path, including borrowed sources. So `concat(a, b)` left `a`/`b` and the
result sharing each element at one refcount; releasing any of them (e.g. `acc = concat(acc, […])` in a
loop, which frees the old `acc`) freed the shared payload out from under the result — a genuine
use-after-free, ASan-confirmed (`heap-use-after-free in lin_string_release` on pristine master). It was
masked in practice only because string *literals* are interned with immortal refcounts; `concat` of
computed strings/objects corrupted the heap. `lin_array_push_tagged` itself MUST stay non-retaining —
its other callers (`io`/`fs`/`json`/`async_rt`/`frozen` building arrays from freshly-owned values, and
the `map`/`minBy`/`maxBy` element-move convention noted in `lower.rs`) deliberately rely on the move
to transfer ownership; adding a retain there would leak. The fix therefore lives in a *separate
retaining copy primitive* selected per-source-ownership inside `concat_dyn`, not in the shared push.

**Consequence**: `concat` of fresh (non-interned) heap values is now memory-safe — the growing-concat
loop runs clean under ASan (only the pre-existing program-lifetime interned-string-cache leak remains;
a scoped concat-of-fresh-strings test leaks nothing of its own). The move-vs-retain split is the
load-bearing invariant: a future change must keep "copy from a still-live borrowed array → retain;
copy from a fresh temp being freed → move". Regression: `test_concat_fresh_strings_no_use_after_free`
(40-iteration growing concat of interpolated strings). The sibling `append`/`prepend` intrinsics
(ADR-062) already retain by the same reasoning; this brings `concat` into line. The analogous
move-without-retain residual leaks in the `for`/`map` element-shell path (`lower.rs`) are a distinct,
pre-existing issue and are not addressed here.

## ADR-065: Flow-typing refinement pins generic combinator array element types so monomorphization emits flat arrays

**Context**: A generic array combinator returns a fresh array whose elements are produced at the
generic param type — `<T, U>(arr: T[], f: (T) => U): U[]`. The only allocation intrinsic whose runtime
representation the compiler fully controls is `lin_array_allocate`, which infers to the Json-wildcard
array `Array(TypeVar(MAX))`. When such a function is MONOMORPHIZED at a concrete-scalar element
(e.g. `U=Int32`), `subst` only rewrites TypeVars that actually appear in the recorded type — it
substitutes `U→Int32` everywhere `U` occurs but never touches the `MAX` wildcard. So the allocation
stays a TAGGED array (`lin_array_alloc_null`, 16-byte slots) while the `Int32[]`-typed consumer reads
it through the FLAT accessor (`lin_flat_array_get_i32`, packed scalars) — a producer/consumer
representation disagreement that reads garbage.

**Decision (checker-side flow-typing, in `lin-check`)**: refine the wildcard element of a fresh
`lin_array_allocate` to the function's declared-return element so monomorphization's existing `subst`
pins `Array(U)` → `Array(Int32)`, and codegen's `is_flat_scalar` gate then emits a flat allocation that
matches the flat reader. Two cases, both gated STRICTLY to the `lin_array_allocate` intrinsic:

- **Direct body (Phase 4.5)**: `=> lin_array_allocate(n)` checked against the declared `Array(elem)`
  retypes the call result via `retype_call_result` (`checker/expr.rs`,
  `is_fresh_array_allocate_call`/`body_is_fresh_array_allocate`).
- **Intermediate binding (Phase 4.5b, this ADR)**: the realistic map-shape body
  `val result = lin_array_allocate(n); …write…; result`. `intermediate_array_allocate_binding`
  (`checker/function.rs`) recognises a `Block` whose final expr is a bare `Ident(name)` bound by an
  un-annotated `val name = lin_array_allocate(..)`; `infer_function`/`infer_function_with_hints` then
  set a transient `array_alloc_elem_hint = (name, elem)` (saved/restored around the body for hygiene,
  so nested/sibling functions are unaffected), and `check_stmt`'s `Stmt::Val` checks that exact binding
  against `Array(elem)`. A user-supplied annotation on the binding wins (the helper bails), keeping the
  programmer's representation choice authoritative.

**Strict gating / correctness invariant**: ONLY the `lin_array_allocate` intrinsic — a fresh allocation
the compiler controls end-to-end — is ever refined. Slice/concat/parse and every other `Json[]`-returning
call (whose runtime representation we do NOT control) is left at `Array(MAX)` (tagged, correct). The
flat/tagged decision is independently re-gated by codegen's `is_flat_scalar`, so a `String[]` or a
still-abstract generic element stays TAGGED. The write into the refined flat array uses `lin_array_set`,
which is representation-aware (dispatches on `elem_tag`, narrowing a tagged value into the packed flat
slot), so producer (flat alloc) / writer (elem_tag-aware set) / reader (flat get) all agree.

**No-op for pre-existing code**: nothing on master/generics-stdlib yet flows a concrete-scalar element
through these patterns (stdlib array.lin is still Json), so the IR is byte-identical — verified by
diffing a map/filter array-combinator program's `-O0` IR with and without the change.

**Covered vs deferred**: the alloc-builder idiom (map/reverse/take/etc. — allocate then index-set and
return) is covered. The `[]`+push builder idiom (filter/reduce: `val result = []; …push(result, x)…;
result`) is DEFERRED. It would need (a) pinning the empty-array-literal binding's element type to the
generic param and (b) representation-aware `Push` codegen — today the non-union `Push` path emits
`lin_array_push`/`lin_array_push_tagged`, which assume the 16-byte tagged layout and would CORRUPT a
flat buffer (only `lin_push_dyn` dispatches on `elem_tag`). Making the empty literal flat without also
making `Push` flat-aware would introduce a new producer/consumer disagreement, so per "correctness over
completeness" the push path is left as a follow-up. NOTE: the push-builder consumed at a concrete-scalar
type already produces garbage on the generics-stdlib baseline (tagged producer, flat reader); this change
neither fixes nor regresses it — the refinement never fires on a `[]` literal (it is a `MakeArray`, not a
`lin_array_allocate` call). Regression tests: `test_generic_map_intermediate_alloc_*`
(int32-flat-and-correct + IR proof, string-stays-tagged, mixed instantiations, json-stays-tagged,
user-annotation-respected) in `crates/lin/tests/integration.rs`. ASan-clean over stdlib + examples + the
flat/tagged/mixed fixtures.

## ADR-066: A `Json` argument binds a generic `T[]` param to the Json wildcard; import-path monomorphization erases leftover inference TypeVars to Json (no garbage monomorph)

**Status:** accepted (Phase 6-pre, prerequisite for genericizing stdlib `array.lin`).

**Context.** Monomorphization specializes a generic function per distinct concrete instantiation,
keying the specialization on the concrete types unified from the call site (`name$Int32`,
`name$Str`, ...). Two related gaps made a generic `T[]` parameter unsafe once stdlib functions
become generic and call each other internally:

1. **Inference gap (lin-check).** `collect_type_subs` (`checker/helpers.rs`) had cases for
   `(Array(T), Array(a))` and `(Array(T), FixedArray(..))` but NONE for `(Array(T), TypeVar(MAX))`
   — i.e. unifying a generic `T[]` param against a `Json` value (`Json == TypeVar(u32::MAX)`).
   So a generic `map<T,U>(arr: T[], ...)` called INTERNALLY by another stdlib fn on its `Json`
   param (e.g. `sortBy` doing `arr.map(...)`) left `T` unbound.
2. **Import-monomorphization soundness bug (lin-ir).** When a type param stayed bound to a
   NON-CONCRETE `TypeVar` at a call inside an imported module, the import path
   (`lower_import_module` -> `monomorphize_import`) materialized a specialization keyed on that
   unsolved id (`map$T44_...`). The body then read/allocated the backing array at a bogus element
   type -> runtime `capacity overflow` / heap corruption (`lin-runtime/src/array.rs`). The
   main-module path tolerated this only because the case rarely arose; the import path hits it
   routinely once stdlib fns call sibling generics on `Json` params.

**Decision.**

- **Bind `T = Json` for a `Json` argument.** Add `(Array(pt), TypeVar(MAX))` and
  `(Iterator(pt), TypeVar(MAX))` arms to BOTH unifiers — `collect_type_subs` (lin-check) and
  `collect_subs` (lin-ir `monomorphize.rs`) — that recurse the element against the Json wildcard.
  A `Json` array argument therefore binds the element TypeVar(s) to `TypeVar(MAX)`, producing a
  representation-consistent TAGGED `$Json` monomorph (`is_flat_scalar(MAX)` is false). A concrete
  `Int32[]` argument still binds `T = Int32` and produces the FLAT `$Int32` monomorph.
- **Erase leftover inference TypeVars to Json before keying a specialization (import safety net).**
  In `monomorphize_inner` (lin-ir), after unifying the call, every binding value is run through
  `erase_nonconcrete_typevars`: any LEFTOVER/unsolved inference `TypeVar` (id `< GENERIC_TV_BASE`,
  e.g. `TypeVar(44)`) is rewritten to the `TypeVar(MAX)` Json wildcard, yielding a safe tagged
  `$Json` monomorph instead of a garbage `$T<id>` one. A QUANTIFIED generic id (`>= GENERIC_TV_BASE`)
  is deliberately LEFT UNTOUCHED so a genuinely-unconstrained param (`val mk = <T>(): T => 0; mk()`)
  still produces the clean "cannot infer a concrete type" diagnostic rather than silently erasing.
  `mangle_type(TypeVar(MAX))` renders as `Json`, so an erased specialization is named `name$Json`.

**Consequences.** A generic `T[]` fn applied to a `Json` value is correct (tagged `$Json`, not
null/garbage/crash); applied to `Int32[]` is still flat `$Int32`. The import path can never emit a
`$T<id>` garbage monomorph or corrupt the heap. **No-op for current code**: no generic stdlib fns
exist yet and no user generic on master flows a `Json` value into a `T[]` param, so the new arms
never fire and the monomorphize pass is still skipped for non-generic modules — `array_pipeline`
`-O0` IR is byte-identical. Regression tests in `crates/lin/tests/integration.rs`:
`test_generic_t_array_param_with_json_arg_is_correct` (+ IR proof of tagged-Json / flat-Int32),
`test_generic_import_path_unbound_typevar_is_safe` (+ IR proof of no `$T<id>` garbage). ASan-clean
over stdlib + examples + both fixtures. Drove the import-path bug by temporarily making stdlib `map`
generic and calling it via `sortBy` (reverted before commit).

## ADR-067: Only direct-index array accessors (`at`/`set`/`indexOf`) are genericized to `<T>(T[], …)`; allocating/builder/dyn-fn/numeric/iterator combinators stay `Json`

**Status:** accepted (Phase 6).

**Context.** Phase 6 set out to convert `stdlib/array.lin` signatures from `Json` to generic `<T>`
so concrete-element callers (`Int32[]`, `String[]`) get type-safety and, where the body is an
alloc-builder, an unboxed flat representation. The prerequisites (ADR-065 flat-write for
alloc-builder bodies; ADR-066 `T=Json` binding + safe import-path TypeVar erasure) are in place. The
governing invariant is **representation consistency**: a value produced as flat (unboxed scalar
buffer) must be read flat, and a value produced as tagged (16-byte `TaggedVal` elements) must be read
tagged. A generic `T[]` return type makes a *concrete-scalar* consumer read the result via the flat
accessor; if the body actually produced a boxed/tagged value, the consumer reads garbage and/or the
runtime corrupts the heap (`array.rs` layout assertions, `ZExt` codegen on a pointer).

**What converted (verified correct on `Int32[]`, `String[]`, heterogeneous `Json[]`, ASan-clean):**
- `at`  → `<T>(arr: T[], index: Int32): T`
- `set` → `<T>(arr: T[], idx: Int32, item: T): Null`
- `indexOf` → `<T>(arr: T[], target: T): Int32`

These are **direct-index accessors**: they read/write a single element through bracket
indexing (`arr[i]` / `arr[i] = item`), which is already element-type-aware in both directions, and
they do **not** allocate a new array nor route the element through an opaque `for`/closure callback
or `push`. The element type flows straight between the typed param/return slot and the tag-aware
index path, so flat and tagged inputs both stay consistent. Purely type-safety wins — no new
allocation, no representation change, so no perf delta and the hot path of `array_pipeline`
(`map`/`filter`/`reduce`, all still `Json`) is functionally unchanged (min-of-9 ≈ 550 ms before and
after; output `1892804906`).

**What stayed `Json` (converting each regressed, with the reason):**
- `map` — alloc-builder, but `result[i] = f(item)` writes the result of an **opaque closure call**,
  which arrives boxed. A flat `U[]` result would write/read it via the unboxed path → garbage
  (`[1,2,3].map(x => x*2)` printed `-1349553662`). Needs the unboxed closure ABI (Phase 5b).
- `push` — the non-union `Push` codegen assumes the tagged layout; a generic `push` to a
  concrete-scalar flat array failed codegen (`ZExt only operates on integer`) and broke every test.
- `slice` / `concat` / `append` / `prepend` — backed by `lin_array_*_dyn` runtime fns that preserve
  the runtime element representation, but a `T[]`-typed monomorph reader for **sub-byte-width flat
  element types** (`UInt8[]`) reads inconsistently: genericizing `slice` regressed the byte
  consumers (`bytes`, `codec/tlv`, `raspberry-controller/rtp`+`nal`). Left `Json`.
- `filter` / `reduce` / `find` / `flatMap` / `partition` / `unique` / `compact` / `take` / `drop` /
  `takeWhile` / `dropWhile` / `zip` / `reverse` / `chunk` / `scan` / `groupBy` / `countBy` —
  `[]`+`push` builders, or alloc-builders that copy the element **through an opaque `for` callback**
  (so the element arrives boxed). Same Phase-5b gap as `map`: a flat-typed reader of the result would
  see garbage. Left `Json`.
- `sum` / `product` / `min` / `max` / `minBy` / `maxBy` — numeric reductions using `+`/`*`/`<`; a
  `<T>` body needs a `<T: Numeric>` constraint Lin lacks, so the body would not type-check. Left
  `Json[]`.
- `for` / `while` / `iter` / `iterOf` / `range` / `rangeStep` — operate on iterables
  (`Iterator<T>`), not just `T[]`; constraining to `T[]` breaks iterator callers. Left `Json`.
- `object.lin` `fromEntries` / `mapValues` / `isEmpty` — object-centric (and `length` is used on
  objects too, so it must stay `Json`); no clean `T[]` win. Left untouched.

**Behaviour note.** `at`/`set`/`indexOf` no longer accept a non-array `Json` (e.g. an `Iterator`)
directly — `range(0,10).at(5)` now reports `expected Int32[]`. No existing stdlib/example caller
relied on that (the only `at` caller, `calc/lexer`, uses `std/string`'s `at`; the only 2-arg `set`
caller uses `std/async`'s `set`). Wrap an iterator in an array (e.g. via `slice`) first.

**Consequences.** Type-safety for the three accessors; representation consistency preserved
everywhere. The flat-pipeline payoff awaits the unboxed closure ABI (Phase 5b) which unblocks the
builder/`for`-callback combinators (and ultimately `map`). Regression: integration 351/0,
stdlib+examples 59/59, all example projects build, ASan-clean. Tests in `stdlib/array.test.lin`
(`at`/`set`/`indexOf` on `Int32[]`+`String[]`+round-trip).

## ADR-068: Route `map`/`filter`/`reduce` through the materializing `lin_*` intrinsics with representation-safe element reads; defer the full unboxed-callback win to a generic-signature + filter-narrowing prerequisite

**Status.** Accepted (partial; the unboxed per-element callback win is investigated, proven in
isolation, and deferred — see below).

**Context (the LINCHPIN goal).** The generics/perf milestone targets ZERO per-element boxing in a
monomorphic array pipeline `range(0,n).map(x=>x*2).filter(x=>x%3==0).reduce(0,(a,x)=>a+x)`. The
blocker is the UNIFORM ALL-PTR BOXED CLOSURE ABI: a closure's stored `fn_ptr` is a
`__cls_wrapb_*` wrapper `ptr(ptr env, ptr boxedArg…) -> ptr boxedRet`, so a combinator calling its
callback via `CallTarget::Indirect` always boxes each element and unboxes the result — per-element
`lin_box_int32`/`lin_unbox_int32` + malloc, even at a concrete element type.

**What this change does (the shipped, fully-tested subset).**
1. `std/array`'s `map`/`filter`/`reduce` are thin wrappers over the `lin_map`/`lin_filter`/
   `lin_reduce` intrinsics (previously these intrinsics existed but were UNUSED; map/filter/reduce
   were hand-written `for`/`push` loops). Their IR lowering (`lower_map`/`lower_filter`/
   `lower_reduce` in `lin-ir/src/lower.rs`) allocates a flat output array for a flat-scalar result
   element and reads flat where the source is provably flat — replacing the old boxed `for`/`push`
   loops. `lin_map`/`lin_filter` now declare an `Array<U>`/`Array<T>` result (was `Iterator`), to
   match the `Json` wrapper and the materialized reality.
2. **Representation-safe element reads (`combinator_read_elem_ty`).** A flat-scalar `T[]` STATIC
   type does NOT guarantee a flat RUNTIME buffer: a `[]`+push builder (`val r=[]; …push(r,x)…; r`)
   allocates a TAGGED array even when later used as `Int32[]` (the empty literal is `Array(Never)`).
   A flat read on it misreads garbage. So each combinator reads at the element type only when the
   source is a PROVABLY-FLAT producer (a `range`/`map`/`filter`/flat-alloc call, or a non-empty
   scalar array literal — `is_provably_flat_producer`); otherwise it reads via the tagged getter
   (`lin_array_get_tagged`, which dispatches on the array's runtime `elem_tag` and is correct for
   both flat and tagged), keeping `[]`+push arrays sound. This fixes a PRE-EXISTING latent
   mismatch (a `[]`+push-typed-`Int32[]` array read flat) that the intrinsic routing would
   otherwise have exposed.
3. **`[]`+push flat-push consistency.** `Intrinsic::Push` now routes a push into a statically
   flat-scalar array (`Array(flat_scalar)`) through `lin_push_dyn` (which dispatches on the runtime
   `elem_tag`, coercing the boxed element into the flat slot) instead of `lin_array_push_tagged`
   (which corrupts a flat buffer). Scalars carry no refcount, so no RC balancing is needed.
4. **Curried-callback codegen fix (latent bug).** The indirect closure-call path treated "result is
   a `Function`" as UNDER-APPLICATION (partial application). A CURRIED callee at full arity that
   RETURNS a function (e.g. a `map` callback `i => () => i`) is indistinguishable from
   under-application by return type alone, so it was wrongly bundled into a partial-application
   closure → garbage. Now disambiguated by ARG-COUNT vs the callee's declared arity
   (`crates/lin-codegen/src/codegen/mod.rs`).
5. **`emit_index_loop` phi back-edge patch (latent bug).** The index-loop scaffold hard-coded the
   loop body block as the phi's back-edge predecessor, which is wrong when the body switches blocks
   (e.g. `filter`'s keep/skip split — never exercised before because nothing called `lin_filter`).
   The phi's back-edge is now patched to the block that actually jumps back to the header
   (`patch_phi_incoming`).
6. **Checker `Array`↔`Iterator` cross-unification** in `collect_type_subs`: a generic `T[]` param
   applied to a runtime `Iterator<Int32>` (e.g. `range(0,n)`) now binds `T=Int32` (mirrors
   `lin-ir`'s monomorphize `collect_subs`), so a generic combinator's callback is typed at the
   concrete element type rather than defaulting to `Json`.

**Result.** array_pipeline output 1892804906 (unchanged). The flat-output intrinsic lowering +
provably-flat reads drop the static box/unbox count (≈55→25) and the apparent debug-build speedup is
large, BUT at the shipped `-O2` level the change is **perf-NEUTRAL** (verified interleaved release
min-of-11: ~168ms before vs ~166ms after — within noise). LLVM's O2 already elides most of the
removed boxing on the hot path, and the per-element callback is still boxed (the lambda parameter is
`Json` without generic signatures), so this is NOT the zero-per-element-box win and delivers no
measurable release speedup yet. (An earlier draft of this ADR cited 1.64x from debug-build numbers —
that does not hold at `-O2`; corrected here.) The real value of this change is the three latent-bug
fixes below plus routing map/filter/reduce through the typed intrinsics as the foundation for the
real win once generic conversion + filter flow-narrowing land (Phase 6-round2). Integration 352/0 (isolated),
stdlib+examples 59/59, all example projects, ASan-clean (stdlib+examples + flat/tagged/mixed/sortBy
fixtures + the `[]`+push-typed-flat case). No-op invariant: a non-combinator program's main IR is
byte-identical to base (only `std/array` differs, the intended change).

**Why the full unboxed-callback win is DEFERRED (the investigation result).** The clean way to get
the lambda parameter typed at the concrete element (eliminating input boxing) AND to route the call
to the intrinsic with the lambda literal VISIBLE (so its body can be inlined unboxed) is to make
`map`/`filter`/`reduce` GENERIC (`<T,U>(T[], (T)=>U): U[]`). A prototype of that — generic
signatures + a monomorphize "thin-wrapper-combinator" call-site inline + a capture-less-lambda
inliner in `lower_map`/`lower_filter`/`lower_reduce` (binding the param to the flat element, lowering
the body inline, carrying a scalar reduce accumulator unboxed through the loop phi) — achieved the
FULL payoff: array_pipeline min-of-9 0.485s → **0.033s (14.7x)**, ZERO box/unbox in the main loops,
ASan-clean. It was NOT shipped because the generic signatures regress the Json/union-typed call
sites the rest of the stdlib and examples rely on:
  - `examples/report`: `validRecords(): Record[]` ends `…filter(r => r["type"]=="success").map(r =>
    r["value"])`. With a precise generic `map`, the body types as `(Record | Null)[]` (the `Null`
    because `r["value"]` on the `Success | Failure` union is nullable — the `filter` does not
    NARROW the union), which is not assignable to `Record[]`. The old `Json`-returning `map`
    absorbed this. Fixing it soundly needs **flow-narrowing through `filter`** (a real checker
    feature), out of scope here.
  - `sortBy`/`minBy`/`maxBy` etc. call `arr.map(item => [keyFn(item), item])` over a `Json[]`; the
    chained generic instantiation over `Json` arrays tripped monomorphize inference gaps and an RC
    mismatch in the `[]`+push pair builder.
Per the milestone's correctness-over-completeness discipline (never ship a broken pipeline), the
generic conversion + the inline mechanism were reverted; only the representation-safe intrinsic
routing + the latent-bug fixes above ship. The full win is unblocked by: (a) generic `map`/`filter`/
`reduce` signatures, (b) `filter` flow-narrowing (so a post-`filter` union member access isn't
nullable), and (c) a Json-permissive fallback for a generic combinator result whose element type
resolves to a non-scalar union — at which point the capture-less-lambda inliner (proven above) lands
the zero-box pipeline. A second candidate, an unboxed-variant closure `fn_ptr` (a closure-struct ABI
change), was judged too high-risk to attempt unattended and is not pursued.

**Consequences.** A representation-safe map/filter/reduce routed through the typed intrinsics with
three latent bugs fixed (curried callback, malformed loop phi, flat-read-on-tagged). Perf-neutral at
`-O2` today (the win is staged behind generic conversion + filter flow-narrowing, see above), but the
correctness fixes and the cleaner intrinsic foundation ship now. The headline zero-box win is staged
behind a documented checker prerequisite rather than shipped broken. **SUPERSEDED by ADR-069**,
which lands the deferred win.

## ADR-069: Generic `map`/`filter`/`reduce` + a capture-less-lambda inliner — the zero-per-element-box array pipeline (10x at -O2)

**Status.** Accepted. This is the shipped completion of the win ADR-068 proved-but-deferred.

**Context.** ADR-068 routed `map`/`filter`/`reduce` through the materializing `lin_*` intrinsics and
proved (in isolation, then reverted) that generic signatures + a capture-less-lambda inliner deliver
ZERO per-element boxing for the monomorphic pipeline
`range(0,n).map(x=>x*2).filter(x=>x%3==0).reduce(0,(a,x)=>a+x)`. It was not shipped because the
generic signatures regressed two call sites. This ADR lands it without regressing anything.

**What shipped.**
1. **Generic signatures** (`stdlib/array.lin`): `map<T,U>(arr:T[], f:(T)=>U): U[]`,
   `filter<T>(arr:T[], f:(T)=>Boolean): T[]`, `reduce<T,U>(arr:T[], init:U, f:(U,T)=>U): U`. At a
   monomorphic scalar call site the checker types the callback param at the concrete element type
   (no input boxing) and the monomorphizer picks the flat (e.g. `$Int32`) specialization.
2. **Call-site combinator-wrapper inline** (`lin-ir/monomorphize.rs`, `try_inline_combinator_wrapper`):
   when a call targets a generic thin intrinsic-combinator wrapper (`map`/`filter`/`reduce`, whose
   body is exactly `lin_map`/… forwarding its params) AND the callback argument is a CAPTURE-LESS
   LITERAL lambda, the call is rewritten in the calling module to a direct `lin_map(arr, <lambda>)`
   (re-homing the intrinsic slot), so the literal lambda is VISIBLE to the intrinsic's IR lowering.
   A capturing lambda or a stored/passed `Function` value is NOT inlined — it falls through to the
   normal closure-call specialization (still correct, just boxed).
3. **Capture-less-lambda inliner in `lower_map`/`lower_filter`/`lower_reduce`** (`lin-ir/lower.rs`,
   `inlinable_lambda` + `inline_lambda_body`): when the callback arg is a capture-less literal
   `Function`, its body is spliced directly into the loop — param bound to the flat element temp,
   body lowered inline — with NO closure alloc and NO per-element box/unbox/indirect call. `reduce`
   additionally carries a CONCRETE-SCALAR accumulator UNBOXED through the loop phi (gated on a scalar
   `result_type`; a union/heap accumulator keeps the boxed Json-phi path). RC: unboxed scalar
   elements/results carry no refcount, so there is no per-iteration box to release — the inliner
   emits none, and ASan confirms no UAF/double-free/leak.

**The two regressions and how they were solved (correctness-first).**
  - **R1 (`examples/report`):** `validRecords()`/`parseErrors()` ended `…filter(…).map(r=>r["value"])`
    over a `Success | Failure` union; with precise generic `map` the element types as `Record | Null`
    (the union member access is nullable, `filter` does not narrow), not assignable to `Record[]`.
    SOLVED by option (a) — restructured the example to be well-typed under precise generics: a named
    helper `recordOf(r: Parsed): Record` (and `errorOf`) narrows the union via an idiomatic
    `match … has { "type": "success", value } => value; else => …` and the pipeline maps through it.
    (The narrowing lives in a named helper, not inline in `.map(…)`, because a multi-arm `match` can't
    be written inside the combinator's parentheses — indentation is suppressed there, ADR-004/014.)
    The example still demonstrates the full map/filter/map churn over heap records.
  - **R2 (`sortBy`/`minBy`/`maxBy`/`compact`/`sum`/…):** these stdlib combinators call `map`/`reduce`/
    `filter` internally over `Json[]`; a SIBLING call to the now-generic combinator specialized at
    `$Json` cross-module, where the combinator's owned-array result and the surrounding generic body's
    RC accounting disagreed — a double-release of the intermediate array (capacity-overflow crash).
    SOLVED by keeping those internal callers on non-generic Json helpers (`_mapJ`/`_filterJ`/
    `_reduceJ`, thin wrappers over the same intrinsics — exactly the pre-generics path), which is
    correct. The generic exports still give the zero-box fast path at the user's monomorphic call site.

**Two supporting fixes (latent gaps the generic conversion exposed, both general correctness wins):**
  - **Cross-module generic specialization for IMPORTED modules** (`lower_import_module_with_imports`,
    `monomorphize_import_with_imports`): a module that imports a generic AND is itself imported (e.g.
    `examples/report` calling `std/array.reduce`) previously did not specialize its cross-module
    generic calls — they fell to the boxed type-erased original (returns `Json`), crashing a concrete
    scalar use site (`ret i32` vs `ptr`). The import path now monomorphizes with the program's imports
    map, exactly like the top-level importer.
  - **`repoint_call_native` re-coercion**: when a native specialization returns a CONCRETE scalar but
    the checker left the Call's `result_type` as the boxed/erased generic return (the `U` TypeVar
    surfaced as `Json` in the surrounding context, e.g. `total = s` with `total: Json`), the Call is
    wrapped in a `Coerce { concrete → original }` so the boxed/unboxed handoff is explicit. Without it
    the consumer emits `store i32`/`ret i32` against a `ptr` slot (a hard codegen type mismatch).

**Result — the HONEST verified release number.** array_pipeline output 1892804906 (unchanged). The hot
map/filter/reduce loops are now FULLY UNBOXED in `main` — flat `lin_flat_array_get_i32`/`push_i32`, a
native `mul`/`srem`/`icmp`/`add`, and the reduce accumulator carried as a native `i32` through the loop
phi — ZERO `lin_box_int32`/`lin_unbox_int32`/closure-call per element (the only two boxes left in
`main` are the FINAL accumulator boxed for `toString` + the print string). Interleaved RELEASE (`-O2`)
min-of-11, same machine, base (ADR-068 Phase 5b) vs after: **~328ms → ~33ms = ~10.0x** (verified twice:
10.06x, 9.95x). This is a real `-O2` speedup, NOT a debug artifact — at `-O2` LLVM cannot elide the
boxed closure ABI's per-element malloc/indirect-call the way it elides the cheaper boxing ADR-068
removed, so eliminating the closure call itself is what unlocks the win.

**Correctness + safety.** stdlib+examples 59/59; integration 355/0 (isolated). map/filter/reduce
verified over `Int32[]` (flat), `String[]`/`Float64[]` (tagged/flat), `Json[]` (heterogeneous);
capturing lambda → closure path (correct); stored-fn-value callback → closure path (correct); chained
pipeline; non-scalar (array/string) reduce accumulator → boxed Json-phi path (correct). ASan-clean over
the full stdlib+examples leg + flat/tagged/capturing/mixed/sortBy/churn fixtures (no UAF/double-free/
leak beyond the known program-lifetime globals). No-op invariant: a non-combinator program's MAIN
module IR is BYTE-IDENTICAL to base (only `std/array` differs — the intended source change).

**Consequences.** The zero-per-element-box array pipeline ships at a verified ~10x `-O2` speedup.
Generic `map`/`filter`/`reduce` + capture-less-lambda inlining is the mechanism; the internal Json
helpers and the union-narrowing example rewrite keep every heterogeneous/union call site correct;
the import-path monomorphization + native-return re-coercion are general fixes for cross-module
generic calls. Capturing lambdas and stored-fn callbacks keep the (correct, boxed) closure path —
inlining the unboxed-closure ABI for those remains future work (judged too high-risk to attempt here).

**R2 bug fix — `filter` over an object/heap array double-freed kept elements (the parked segfault).**
The original ADR-069 commit (e9274f5) made `filter` produce a result array of the SOURCE's concrete
element type. For a CONCRETE-rc element (an object/array/string — e.g. `std/test`'s `Assertion[]`, or
any `Object[]`), `filter`'s keep path pushes the element it READ from the source array straight into
the result array via the `Push` intrinsic. For a concrete tagged element that intrinsic lowers to
`lin_array_push_tagged`, which raw-copies the 16-byte `TaggedVal` WITHOUT bumping the inner refcount
(MOVE semantics — correct only for a freshly-owned value). But filter's element is BORROWED: it is
still owned by the source array. So the source and the filtered array both referenced the same object
at refcount 1, and releasing both at scope/teardown double-freed it → heap-use-after-free
(`lin_object_release`), surfacing as the `examples/*/*.test.lin` (codec/report/…) segfault via
`std/test`'s `results.filter(a => a["type"]=="fail")`. (On the pre-payoff base `filter` returned a
`Json` array, whose elements push via the RETAINING `lin_push_dyn`, so the bug did not exist there.)
Fix: `push_output` now takes a `borrowed` flag. `filter` (which pushes the borrowed source element)
passes `borrowed: true`; on a tagged concrete-rc push it emits a `Retain` first so the result array
owns its own reference. `map` (which pushes the lambda's freshly-owned result) passes `borrowed:
false` and keeps the MOVE. Union elements (retaining `lin_push_dyn`) and flat scalars (no refcount)
need nothing, so the flat-scalar pipeline win is untouched — the fix is purely the missing retain on
the borrowed-concrete-element tagged push, and the full object-array inline win is RETAINED (no path

## ADR-070: `await` enforces Error handling via `T | Error` (no nominal Promise type)

**Decision.** `await` is typed as a generic `<T>(p: T): T | Error` in `stdlib/async.lin`. It is the
single point where a faulted async computation surfaces as an `Error` value (spec §32.2.2), so it is
also the single point where the `Error` member is injected into the type. The result is a union
`T | Error`, and the *existing* union-assignment check — the same machinery `fromJson` relies on
(ADR-047) — rejects assigning it to a bare target type:

```
val r: Int32 = await(p)   // Error: Expected type Int32, got ?T | { "type": String, "message": String }
```

To consume the result you must handle the `Error` case (`match … is Error => … else => …`), exactly
as the spec intends. No new checker, codegen, runtime, or intrinsic code was needed; the feature is a
pure stdlib signature change leaning on generics (ADR-063) plus the pre-existing union-vs-bare check.

**Why `await`, not `async`.** The natural reading of the spec ("async wraps its return in `T|Error`")
is *not* codegen-sound here, and an early attempt to type `async` as `<T>(f: () => T): T | Error`
crashed codegen (`Found PointerValue … but expected the IntValue variant` in `boxing.rs`). The reason:
`async`/`poolAsync`/`race`/`timeout`/`retry` all return a **live `LinPromise*` handle**, not a resolved
value — the value only materialises at `await`. A union type forces a boxed-`TaggedVal*` representation
and scalar boxing; applying it to a promise pointer makes codegen try to box the promise *as* its inner
scalar, which is a representation mismatch. So every promise-*producing* wrapper keeps its opaque `Json`
typing (a `LinPromise*` is just an opaque pointer, same as `Json`), and only the promise-*consuming*
`await` — whose runtime result genuinely is a boxed value — carries the `T | Error` union. This still
satisfies §32.2.2 (you cannot use an awaited result without handling the `Error`), which is the rule the
spec actually cares about; it just attaches the union one call later than the prose suggests.

**Why lightweight (no `Type::Promise<T>`).** Introducing a nominal `Type::Promise<T>` would touch
type compat/resolve/zonk/monomorphize, every async intrinsic signature, and codegen boxing — a large,
risky change for the §32.2.2 guarantee alone. The generic-union approach reuses what already exists.

**Known limitation (honest).** Because there is no nominal `Promise<T>` and a promise handle is erased
to `Json`, this enforces *"you must handle the Error after awaiting"* but does **not** catch *"you forgot
to await"* — i.e. using a promise as if it were the value. A real `Type::Promise<T>` would catch the
latter (a promise wouldn't be assignable to its inner type), but at the cost above. This is not a
regression: the previous all-`Json` typing didn't catch the forgotten-await case either. Deferred.

**Narrowing footnote.** Match narrowing does not strip the structural `Error` member from an
`?T | Error` union whose `T` is an unsolved type variable (the awaited value, since the promise is
`Json`). So `match await(…) is Error => … else => result` leaves `result` typed as the full union in
the `else` arm rather than `?T`. Routing the awaited value through a `Json`-typed boundary (a tiny
`(r: Json): Int32 => match r is Error => … else => r` helper) sidesteps this and coerces cleanly; the
concurrency examples and async tests use that helper for happy-path arithmetic. Improving union
narrowing over unsolved type variables is a separate, pre-existing checker concern.
