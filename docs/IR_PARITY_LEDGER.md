# IR Parity Burn-Down Ledger

Tracks the failure set of the integration suite run on the **IR path**
(`LIN_USE_IR=1 cargo test -p lin --test integration`) as we bring it to parity
with the TypedAST path. Per the plan, this set must shrink monotonically to zero
by the Phase 8 parity gate.

Working branch: `ir-sole-path` (worktree at `/tmp/lin-ir-sole-path`, off `master` @ `fa2943e`).

## Baseline — Phase 0 (start)

- **AST leg:** 128 integration + 33 type_check + 6 snapshots + 6 lin_ir unit = **green, 0 failures**.
- **IR leg (integration):** **7 passed / 121 failed** of 128.

The 7 "passes" are all compile-time-error or formatter tests that never reach IR
codegen (`test_cannot_assign_immutable_error`, `test_division_by_zero_error`,
`test_fmt_idempotent`, `test_if_old_syntax_error`, `test_modulo_by_zero_error`,
`test_object_spread_null_error`, `test_undefined_variable_error`). **No program
that actually executes IR-generated code currently works.**

### Root-cause confirmed at baseline
`test_hello_world` builds and exits 0 but prints nothing. The emitted `.ll` shows
`main()` creating the `"hello world"` string and immediately releasing it — **the
`print` call was dropped entirely during lowering**, even though `print`/`lin_print`
is one of the 5 "mapped" intrinsics. So the gap is broader than missing intrinsic
variants: imported-function call emission and intrinsic dispatch through imported
wrappers are not wired in the IR path. Phase 1 must address call lowering, not just
the intrinsic name table.

## Phase 1 discovery — import resolution is a hidden foundational gap

The earlier exploration reported lowering "covers all 7 TypedStmt variants except
IndexSet." That is misleading: `lower_stmt`'s `Import`/`ForeignImport` arms
(`lower.rs:303-317`) only allocate **placeholder temps** — they do not connect an
import binding to the compiled target function. Consequently `lower_call`
(`lower.rs:594-618`) finds the import slot is neither an `intrinsic_slot` nor a
`global_fn_slot`, falls through, and emits an **indirect call on a dead placeholder
temp** — which the IR codegen drops to null. So **every call to an imported symbol
silently vanishes**, which is why `print` (and therefore essentially every real
program) produces no output. This is the dominant cause of the 121 failures, and it
sits *below* the intrinsic-catalogue work the plan scheduled for Phase 1.

`std/io`'s `print` is a normal exported `val` lowered to LLVM `std_io_print`
(`{module_key}_{name}` mangling, codegen `register_import`). The IR `Call`
handler's `CallTarget::Named(name)` arm already resolves via
`self.module.get_function(name)` (codegen.rs:7190) — so the fix is to make lowering
resolve import slots to `Named("<module_key>_<name>")` (and imported non-fn vals to
their `{module_key}_{name}__val` wrappers), rather than to placeholder temps.
`lower_module` will need the import map / module-key info that today only codegen has.

**Revised Phase 1 scope:** (a) thread import resolution into `lower_module` and emit
real `Named` targets for import/foreign-import slots; (b) THEN the intrinsic-name
catalogue; (c) CI scaffolding. Item (a) was not in the approved plan's Phase 1 and is
a prerequisite for any program to run on the IR path.

## Remaining failures after Phase 1 foundation (74)

Bucketed against the plan's later phases — confirms the remaining work maps onto
the scheduled phases rather than more hidden foundational gaps:

- **Loops / iteration (Phase 4):** for_and_range, map_filter_reduce, iter_builtin,
  iterator_restart, chaining, multiline_chain, stdlib_array_* — control-flow
  intrinsics still lower to no-ops (`_ => null`).
- **Pattern matching / match (Phase 4):** pattern_matching_is/has,
  array_pattern_matching_*, tagged_unions, string_literal_pattern,
  non_exhaustive_match_error, tco_in_match, match_with_block_body.
- **Partial application (Phase 6):** functions_and_partial_application,
  dot_partial_application, partial_application_chain, higher_order_functions.
- **TCO (Phase 7):** tail_call_optimization, recursion, recursive_fibonacci,
  mutual_recursion_via_forward_decl.
- **Async (Phase 5):** async_await_basic, async_val_capture, parallel_three_thunks,
  thread_pool_async, worker_request_reply.
- **Closures/var:** closures_and_var, multiple_closures_share_var,
  forward_reference_in_closure.
- **fs/http/server (need investigation — may share a common cause):** fs_*, http_*,
  server_*, io_lines/io_read.
- **Misc to investigate:** equality, not_equal, numeric_comparison, string_comparison,
  if_expressions, if_block_branches, chained_if_else, continuation_*,
  index_assign (IndexSet — Phase 2), keys_values_entries, push_and_concat,
  nested_objects_access, object_equality_deep, object/array_rest_destructuring,
  is_has_as_boolean_expressions, speculative_reads_typed_union, multi_param_lambda,
  multi_statement_*_lambda/paren, interp_with_expressions, array_oob_error,
  mixed_numeric_operations.

## Progress log

| Phase | IR-leg failures | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 0 (baseline) | 121 / 128 | starting point |
| 1a (import resolution) | 83 / 128 | resolve import/foreign slots to `Named` targets + box concrete args to Json params; 45 passing. AST leg still 128/128. |
| 1b (top-level fn FuncId) | 77 / 128 | top-level fn vals reused a fresh FuncId instead of the pre-assigned `global_fn_slots` id (Direct calls panicked); also main must be FuncId(0). 51 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 1c (ToString by input type) | 74 / 128 | `compile_to_string_value` dispatched on LLVM value kind, treating `Str` as a tagged ptr (broke string interp). Thread arg types into `compile_ir_intrinsic`; delegate to type-driven `value_to_string_simple`. 54 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 1d (boxed-object index) | 61 / 128 | `Index` carried no object/key types, so indexing a Json-boxed object (e.g. `stat(p)["size"]`) called `lin_object_get` on the `TaggedVal*` directly → null. Added `obj_ty`/`key_ty` to the `Index` instruction; unbox boxed containers/keys before runtime accessors. Unblocked the fs/http/server cluster. 67 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 2 (IndexSet + flat read) | 59 / 128 | added `IndexSet` IR instruction + `compile_ir_index_set` (object/array/dynamic dispatch); fixed `compile_ir_index` to use `flat_array_get`/`lin_array_get_tagged` per result type (was always tagged → garbage for flat scalar arrays). 69 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 2b (if-branch RC scope) | 59 / 128 | **heap-corruption fix:** `lower_if` registered branch-local heap temps in the enclosing scope, so the merge block released both branches' temps (only one branch ran) → SIGABRT. Each branch now gets its own ownership scope. No count change but fixes latent UB; validates the ASan plan. AST leg 128/128. |
| 2c (Binary operand type) | 53 / 128 | `Binary` carried only the result type, so `==`/comparisons got `lty=Bool` and did scalar compares instead of object/array deep equality (`{..}=={..}` → false). Added `operand_ty` to `Binary`; pass it to `compile_eq`/`compile_cmp`. 75 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4a (Phi / SSA merge) | 45 / 128 | the IR codegen had **no SSA merge** — `lower_if` copied both branches into a shared temp, and the single-pass codegen let the last-compiled branch win for both runtime paths (if-expressions crashed/wrong). Added a `Phi` IR instruction (records actual predecessor block per branch) + LLVM phi codegen with deferred backpatch (so loop back-edge values resolve). 83 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4b (named-fn closure wrap) | 41 / 128 | passing a named (capture-less) function as a `Function` param stored the raw fn ptr in a closure struct, but call sites invoke `fn_ptr(env, args...)` → env shifted all args (`apply(add,7)`→7 not 14). Wrap capture-less `MakeClosure` targets via `wrap_named_fn_as_closure`. 87 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4c (loops as IR blocks) | 36 / 128 | lowered for/while/map/filter/reduce/range to explicit LinIR CFG (header phi + back-edge); added ArrayAlloc/FlatArray intrinsic codegen; callback ABI coercion (box args to Json params, coerce fn returns); **heap-box escaping values** (compile_ir_box/coerce used a stack alloca → dangling boxed returns, the `[object]` bug); union-operand arithmetic re-boxes when result is Json. 92 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4d (Function-arg RC) | 34 / 128 | AST-compiled callees release their Function-typed params at return, so a closure passed from IR-main was freed by the callee then released again at module exit → double-free segfault. Retain Function-typed args before Named/Direct calls. 94 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4e (match Phi + arg/field boxing) | 33 / 128 | `lower_match` used the same broken shared-Copy merge as if (→ `[object]`); now emits a Phi and boxes the scrutinee for `is`/`has` tag tests. Box concrete args to Json params for global (Direct) calls too. Add `obj_ty` to `FieldGet` and unbox boxed-object containers (fixes destructure of a boxed param). 95 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4f (literal patterns + panic term) | 31 / 128 | `is "lit"` patterns were lowered as type-only checks (matched any same-typed value); now emit a value equality (`lin_tagged_eq`, fixed to i8 return + literal boxed to Json). Removed the double-terminator from `Panic` codegen (it emitted `unreachable` AND the IR terminator did → verifier error). 97 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 7 (TCO TailCall) | 30 / 128 | implemented the `TailCall` terminator (was a `build_unreachable` stub → deep self-recursion stack-overflowed). Functions with a tail call get a param-alloca prologue + loop-header that reloads params each iteration; `TailCall` stores new args and branches back. Marked post-tail-call blocks "diverged" so they don't become phi predecessors. `count(1_000_000,0)` now returns without overflow. 98 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 6 (partial application) | 28 / 128 | under-applied Direct/Named calls (args < arity, Function result) now build a partial-application closure via a value-input port of `build_partial_application`. `add(5)(10)`→15. 100 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 6b (narrowed LocalGet unbox) | 27 / 128 | a Json slot narrowed to a concrete type in a match arm (e.g. `is String => x`) read the boxed value without unboxing → null/garbage. `LocalGet` now emits a `Coerce` when the stored slot type is union but the use wants concrete. 101 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 6c (closure env + uniform return) | 27 / 128 | closures capturing values crashed: env reads used `lin_object_get` on the raw env struct, and a closure returning a concrete scalar was called via the opaque-Function ABI expecting a ptr return. Added an `EnvCapture` IR instruction (raw struct load at offset 8+i*8) and made closures use a uniform boxed (Json) return ABI. Capturing-param closures work (`adder(10)(5)`→15); mutable var-capture-by-ref still pending. 101 passing. AST leg 128/128. |

## Status checkpoint (Phases 1–7 substantially complete)

**IR-leg integration: 103 / 128 passing** (from a 7/128 baseline). AST leg: **128/128
throughout**. ~21 commits, each verified.

Architecture delivered (Option B):
- Import/foreign call resolution; top-level FuncId fix; ToString-by-type.
- Index/IndexSet/FieldGet carry object/key types; box/unbox at boundaries; flat vs
  tagged array reads.
- **Phi-based SSA merge** (if-exprs, match) with deferred back-edge backpatch.
- **Loops as explicit IR blocks** (for/while/map/filter/reduce/range) + ArrayAlloc/
  FlatArray intrinsics; callback ABI (box args to Json params, uniform boxed closure
  return, re-box union arithmetic).
- **Closures**: EnvCapture instruction (raw env-struct load); capture-less wrapping;
  uniform boxed return ABI.
- **TCO**: structural TailCall loop transform (param allocas + header reload).
- **Partial application** (value-input port).
- Heap-boxing of escaping values; Function-arg retain to balance callee consume;
  narrowed-slot unbox; Val/Var + array-element coercion to declared representation;
  mixed int/float widening; literal-pattern value equality.

### Remaining failures (25), by area
- **Closures / curry / mutable var-capture (≈5):** closures_and_var,
  multiple_closures_share_var, higher_order_functions, partial_application_chain,
  forward_reference_in_closure. Curried-closure return ABI when the inner fn type is
  inferred; mutable `var` captured by reference (heap cell) not yet modelled in IR.
- **Array pattern / rest destructuring (≈4):** array_pattern_matching_is/has,
  array_rest_destructuring, object_rest_destructuring. Rest slicing + array-pattern
  binding need IR support.
- **Async / concurrency (≈5):** async_await_basic, async_val_capture,
  parallel_three_thunks, thread_pool_async, worker_request_reply. IR codegen for
  async/await/exit exists; the stdlib wrappers are still AST-compiled, so full parity
  needs the IR path to compile imports too (or the wrapper RC interaction resolved).
- **Iterators (2):** iter_builtin, iterator_restart — `lin_iter` not yet lowered.
- **Heterogeneous-literal boxing (≈3):** tagged_unions, tostring_objects_and_arrays,
  speculative_reads_typed_union — boolean (and null) boxing inside mixed Json arrays.
- **stdlib array fns (2):** stdlib_array_find_some_every, flatmap_indexof_reverse.
- **FFI / fs (2):** ffi_end_to_end_c_library, fs_read_lines.
- **TCO (1):** tail_call_optimization — a specific shape still failing (basic + deep TCO work).
- **pattern_matching_has (1).**

## Checkpoint 2 — 113/128 (Phases 1–7 + most edge cases)

Since the last checkpoint (103): uniform closure return ABI completed (curried/HOF
calls), array rest + array pattern matching, object rest, `iter()` as IR blocks,
mixed int/float widening, has-pattern value constraints, if-branch result coercion.
AST leg green throughout.

### Remaining (15) — root causes identified
1. **Mutable `var` captured by closure (heap cell)** — `closures_and_var`,
   `multiple_closures_share_var`, and (via stdlib `some`/`every`, which mutate a
   captured `var` inside a `lin_while` body) `stdlib_array_find_some_every`. The IR
   models `var` as a plain SSA temp; captured-and-mutated `var` needs a heap cell shared
   by reference (ADR-015). Largest remaining piece; comparable in size to the loop work.
2. **RC of an object returned from a function then matched** — `tagged_unions`,
   `tostring_objects_and_arrays`, `speculative_reads_typed_union`. A `match`/`has` on a
   freshly-returned object reads a dangling entry key — an RC-ordering bug in how the
   object's interior is owned across the function-return + match boundary.
3. **Async/concurrency** — `async_val_capture`, `parallel_three_thunks`,
   `thread_pool_async`, `worker_request_reply`. IR async/await codegen exists, but the
   stdlib async wrappers are AST-compiled; full parity needs the IR path to compile
   imports too (Phase 9 territory) or the wrapper RC interaction resolved.
4. **FFI / fs** — `ffi_end_to_end_c_library`, `fs_read_lines`.
5. **Misc** — `partial_application_chain`, `pattern_matching_has`,
   `stdlib_array_flatmap_indexof_reverse`, `tail_call_optimization` (a specific shape).

## Checkpoint 3 — 114/128 (stable stopping point)

Net since checkpoint 2: object-return RC fix (function boxing its result kept the raw
object too), array/object rest, iter, has-value-constraints, mixed numeric widening.

**14 remaining**, dominated by two hard themes — both surfaced as real heap corruption
(`stdlib/` run reports `malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk`, validating the planned ASan leg):

1. **Mutable `var` captured by a closure** (heap-cell semantics, ADR-015) — not yet
   modelled in the IR (var is a plain SSA temp). Blocks closures_and_var,
   multiple_closures_share_var, and stdlib some/every (→ stdlib_array_find_some_every).
   This is the single largest remaining feature (comparable to the loop/TCO work):
   needs cell alloc + load/store-through-cell + capture-cell-pointer across lowering,
   the IR model, and codegen.
2. **RC ordering for boxed objects flowing through match value-constraints** —
   tagged_unions, speculative_reads_typed_union (and contributes to the var/async
   crashes). The has-pattern value-constraint path (Index read + boxed literal compare)
   leaks/aliases; flaky crash vs empty output indicates a missing release or aliasing read.

Plus: async/concurrency (async_val_capture, worker_request_reply — stdlib async wrappers
are AST-compiled), FFI/fs (ffi_end_to_end_c_library, fs_read_lines), and one-offs
(partial_application_chain, pattern_matching_has, tail_call_optimization,
tostring_objects_and_arrays).

### Recommended next steps (in order)
- Add the **ASan/LSan CI leg + RC-stress fixtures** (deferred Phase 1 infra) BEFORE
  further RC work — the long-tail is now clearly memory-safety-bound.
- Implement mutable-var heap cells (biggest unlock).
- Resolve the has-value-constraint RC aliasing.
- Then the parity gate (Phase 8) and milestone-1 merge ask.

## Checkpoint 4 — 124/128 (strong stopping point)

Since checkpoint 3 (120): tagged_unions (multi-match + has value-constraints, via per-arm
ownership scopes + scoped value-constraint temps + branchless has/arraylen helpers),
stdlib some/every (box `==` rhs by value kind), fs_read_lines (any-width int array index),
closures-stored-in-arrays + multiple_closures_share_var (retain Function array elements +
unbox boxed callee), mutable-var-capture heap cells, array/object rest, iter, partial
application, TCO (incl. Int64), guards. **AST leg green (128/128) throughout; ~30 commits.**

### Final remaining (4) — each needs a distinct, non-trivial feature
1. **async_val_capture** — root cause found: a closure that references a top-level
   (module-level) `val` reads a placeholder instead of the value. The IR path lowers
   module vals into `main`'s slots; closures can't see them. The AST path emits them as
   LLVM globals (`global_val_slots`) and loads from there. Fix: lower top-level non-fn
   vals as globals (or capture-by-value into closures). Also blocks any closure over a
   module val.
2. **partial_application_chain** — `add3(1)(2)(3)`: a partial-application wrapper called
   with fewer args than its remaining params must itself partially apply. Indirect closure
   calls carry no arity, so under-application isn't detected. Needs arity metadata on
   closures or a curried-wrapper representation.
3. **ffi_end_to_end_c_library** — FFI: `import foreign` C symbol linkage on the IR path.
4. **worker_request_reply** — worker-thread concurrency primitives (thread pool / channels).

### Recommended next steps
- Add the **ASan/LSan CI leg + RC-stress fixtures** (deferred Phase 1 infra). The many
  RC fixes in checkpoints 2–4 (heap-box escaping values, per-branch/arm scopes,
  function-arg/array-element retains, null handling) are exactly what a sanitizer leg
  guards; it should land before the parity gate.
- Module-global vals in closures (unblocks async_val_capture).
- Then the Phase 8 parity gate and the Milestone-1 merge **ask** (still off by default).

## Checkpoint 5 — 127/128 integration (near-complete)

Since checkpoint 4 (124): module-level vals as globals (async_val_capture + any closure
over a module val), foreign-library link paths on the IR path (FFI), and void closures
return void not boxed-Json (worker_request_reply + async stdlib). FFI example runs;
11/12 non-network examples pass; 10/14 stdlib test files pass. AST leg 128/128 throughout.

### Final integration failure (1)
- **partial_application_chain** — `add3(1)(2)(3)`: a partial-application closure called
  with fewer args than its remaining params must itself partially apply. Needs closure
  arity metadata (e.g. stored in the closure struct's pad field) so the indirect call
  site can detect under-application and build a nested partial. Localized but non-trivial.

### Remaining stdlib test failures (4: array/string/object/path)
Heap-corruption crashes (e.g. `object.rs:124 misaligned pointer`, payload looks like
string bytes) under the heavy operation mix in the stdlib suites — RC-aliasing edge cases
not hit by the integration tests. These are exactly what the planned ASan/LSan leg is
meant to surface and pin down; recommend adding it before chasing them individually.

### Net status vs. the plan
All Phase 1–7 architecture is implemented and the IR path runs essentially the whole
language: literals, operators (incl. mixed numeric), strings/interp, objects/arrays
(flat + tagged), destructuring (+ rest), if/match (+ guards, literal/array/object
patterns, value constraints), closures (captures, mutable-var cells, curried, HOF),
partial application (one level), loops (for/while/map/filter/reduce/range/iter) as
explicit IR blocks, TCO, async/await, FFI, imports. The remaining items are one curried
edge case, a handful of stdlib RC corners, and worker-thread concurrency.

**Next:** ASan/LSan CI leg + RC-stress fixtures → finish the stdlib RC corners and the
curried-partial case → Phase 8 parity gate → Milestone-1 merge **ask** (IR still off by default).

## Checkpoint 6 — 127/128 integration, 10/14 stdlib (final push state)

Since checkpoint 5: tagged comparison (lin_tagged_cmp) for boxed string/number ordering
(string sort works); forced concrete return for callbacks with concrete params; box `==`
rhs by value kind; unbox boxed indirect callee; void closures return void. AST 128/128.

### Remaining integration failure (1)
- **partial_application_chain** (`add3(1)(2)(3)`): needs closure arity metadata so a
  partial closure called with too few args re-partial-applies.

### Remaining stdlib-suite failures (4: array/string/object/path)
Root-caused to a specific **AST-stdlib ↔ IR-closure return-ABI** corner:
higher-order stdlib functions (groupBy, countBy, …) take a callback with a Json/TypeVar
param and a CONCRETE return (e.g. `keyFn: (Json) => String`). AST's
`build_closure_call_typed` calls TypeVar-param closures with a boxed (ptr) return and then
unboxes the result. An IR closure under the uniform boxed ABI returns a boxed value, which
AST unboxes — but the round-trip mis-handles a `String` payload (crash reads the string's
data bytes as a pointer, e.g. `0x6c6c61` = "all"). The closure itself is correct (calling
keyFn directly works); the defect is at the AST-callee/IR-closure boundary for
concrete-return-over-Json callbacks. Needs the IR closure's return convention reconciled
with AST `build_closure_call_typed`'s unbox-on-TypeVar-params rule.

The integration suite — the canonical parity measure — is 127/128 and stable. The stdlib
suites stress higher-order interop more heavily and surface this one boundary issue plus
its downstream RC effects.

## Checkpoint 7 — 128/128 integration, 14/14 stdlib, ASan-clean (PARITY REACHED)

Closed out every remaining failure. The IR leg now matches the AST leg exactly on the
integration suite, the stdlib suite, and the non-skipped examples, and every stdlib test
file is heap-clean under AddressSanitizer.

### Fixes since checkpoint 6

1. **Array-element ownership (heap corruption).** `MakeArray` lowering retained the *box*
   (TaggedVal) instead of the underlying heap value, and left fresh-alloc elements in the
   owning scope so they were released both directly and recursively via the container →
   double-free. Fixed by managing RC on the raw element value: a *fresh* allocation
   transfers its +1 into the array (dropped from the scope via `unregister_owned`), a
   *borrowed* element is retained. `expr_is_fresh_alloc` widened to match AST's
   `expr_is_owned_alloc` exactly (Call/MakeArray/MakeObject/StringLit/StringInterp/Function
   + If/Match/Block/Coerce recursion).

2. **Curried partial application of a closure value** (`add3(1)(2)(3)`). Under-applying a
   closure whose result type is still `Function` now builds a nested partial-application
   wrapper (`build_closure_partial_application_values`) that captures the inner closure +
   supplied args and takes the remaining params — mirroring AST `build_closure_call`'s
   Function-result branch, under the uniform boxed ABI. No closure arity metadata needed:
   keyed purely on the `ret_ty` being `Function`, exactly like the AST path.

3. **Partial-application closure env_size.** Both partial-application closure builders
   never wrote `env_size` at offset 24, so `lin_closure_release` read garbage and freed the
   env with a bogus layout (`malloc unaligned` / heap corruption). Now written explicitly
   (lin_alloc does not zero).

4. **Dup-on-projection.** `Index`/`FieldGet` of a heap type returns a *borrowed* alias into
   the container. Binding it to an owned `var`/`val` (which releases on reassignment and at
   scope exit) freed a value the container still owned. Now retained + registered as owned
   on projection (IR path), and the analogous borrowed-projection retain added to the AST
   `TypedStmt::Var` initializer (a latent AST-path UAF that production masked by leaking the
   container — the IR path's correct array release exposed it).

5. **rc_elide soundness: escapes are interference.** The elision pass only treated
   calls/allocations as interference, so it removed a retain/release pair straddling an
   *escape* (`MakeCell`/`CellSet`/`IndexSet`/`GlobalValSet`) — instructions that create an
   independent owner which releases later. Eliding that retain caused a use-after-free. The
   interference predicate now includes the escape instructions.

### Known-broken examples (skipped on BOTH legs, pre-existing)
`showcase.lin` and `template.lin` import `length` (and friends) from `std/string`, which
does not export them. The AST path silently mis-compiles this to a `call ptr null(...)`
(no output, exit 0); the IR path fails loudly at link time (`undefined reference to
std_string_length__val`). These two are already in CI's skip list on both legs, so they are
outside the parity gate. The IR behaviour here is strictly *more* correct (loud failure vs.
silent null call).

### Status
Integration: **128/128** (AST and IR). Stdlib: **14/14** (AST and IR), **all 14 ASan-clean
on the IR leg**. Non-skipped examples: all run on the IR leg. lin-ir unit tests: pass.
The Milestone-1 parity gate is met — IR is at parity but still OFF by default.

## Architectural note for Milestone 2 (legacy deletion blocker)

The IR path currently compiles **only the main module** through `compile_module_from_ir`.
Imported modules — the entire stdlib — are still compiled by the **AST** path via
`register_import` → `compile_function_body` → `compile_expr`. The IR lowering of the main
module resolves imported symbols to `Named` calls into those AST-compiled functions.

Consequence: Phase 10 ("delete the legacy TypedAST path") **cannot** simply delete
`compile_module`/`compile_expr` while `register_import` depends on them. Before legacy
deletion, imports must be routed through the IR pipeline too (lower each imported
`TypedModule` to a `LinModule` and codegen it via the IR path, or have `register_import`
lower+emit per function through the IR instruction emitter). This is a prerequisite work
item for Milestone 2, not covered by the original Phase 10 estimate.

It also explains why several RC corner cases surfaced as AST-stdlib bugs masked by leaks:
the AST-compiled stdlib leaks containers that the IR-compiled caller correctly releases,
exposing latent AST use-after-frees (e.g. `std_path_join`'s borrowed `parts[0]`). Those have
been fixed in the AST path directly (dup-on-projection in `TypedStmt::Var`), so both paths
are now sound regardless of which compiles the stdlib.

## Checkpoint 8 — IR-compiled imports (Milestone 2 prerequisite, partial)

Imports now compile through the LinIR pipeline (`lower_import_module` +
`compile_import_from_ir`) instead of the AST path, removing the IR path's dependency on
`compile_function_body`/`compile_expr` for imported modules. This unblocks Phase 10
(legacy deletion), which previously could not proceed while `register_import` used the AST.

### Status
- **Integration: 128/128 on BOTH legs.**
- **Stdlib: 11/14 on the IR leg** (14/14 on AST). Failing: array, fs, template.
- All non-skipped examples run on the IR leg. AST leg fully green (no regressions).

### Fixes made for IR-compiled imports
1. **Cross-module FuncId collision** (root cause of most early crashes): each module's
   lowering numbers FuncIds from 0, and codegen named anonymous functions `__lin_fn_<id>`.
   The main module's and each import's identically-numbered anon functions collided, so the
   second definition's blocks were appended to the first (an orphan `entry2: No predecessors`
   block bleeding another function's body). Fixed with a per-module `ir_anon_prefix`
   (`std_test_` etc.) on anonymous-function symbols.
2. **Length** dispatches on the arg's static type (string/array/object/dyn), matching AST.
3. **Print** converts its arg to a string first (was passing a boxed Json to lin_print).
4. **Push / object_set / array_set / keys / value_key / array_allocate(_filled)** intrinsics
   implemented as value-input ports with correct unbox/box of args.
5. **Async family** (parallel/race/timeout/retry/threadPool/worker/request/message/close)
   ported to value-input intrinsic handlers; async thunk unboxed when boxed.
6. **if/while condition** coerced to Bool (a `Function` predicate returns boxed Json;
   CondJump needs i1, else codegen defaulted the branch to false).
7. **Null `var`-cell promotion**: `var x = null` later reassigned is typed `Null` by the
   checker; the heap cell is promoted to `Json` so writes/reads box/unbox correctly (both at
   the MakeCell site and the closure-capture site).
8. **MakeObject union field**: a Json-typed field value is already a TaggedVal* — store it
   directly (re-boxing tagged it TAG_NULL, so reads saw null).
9. **Binary tagged_eq/cmp rhs**: box the rhs by its STATIC type, so a raw `LinString*` from
   a string literal (`x == "pass"`) is boxed before lin_tagged_eq (was read as a TaggedVal).
10. **Index string-key-on-Json**: guard lin_object_get with a TAG_OBJECT runtime check
    (`results["type"]` where results is actually an array must return Null, not crash).
11. **Object spread**: unbox a Json spread source to LinObject* before lin_object_merge.
12. **push element ownership**: a fresh element transfers its +1 into the array (codegen's
    push doesn't retain); a borrowed element is retained — mirrors MakeArray.

### Remaining 3 stdlib failures (deferred)
All are subtle RC/ABI corners in the IR-compiled stdlib, exposed because the IR path's
(valid) refcount/boxing differs from the AST path:
- **fs.test**: `resolve_lin_str` in the runtime sniffs `*ptr` to tell a boxed TaggedVal*
  from a raw LinString* — but offset 0 of a LinString is its `refcount`, so when the rc's
  low byte == TAG_STR(6) it mis-unboxes and reads the char data as a pointer. The IR path
  inflates refcounts more than AST (per-read retains), hitting rc≡6. This is a latent
  runtime design flaw; the proper fix is a non-ambiguous boxed/raw discriminator for
  `import foreign "lin-runtime"` string params.
- **array.test**: `array_to_json_string` overflows a Vec — a nested array's `len` field is
  corrupted (toString of nested arrays), pointing at a container RC/transfer bug.
- **template.test**: not yet root-caused.

## Checkpoint 9 — IR-compiled imports COMPLETE (full parity)

The import migration is done. Imported modules (the whole stdlib) compile through the LinIR
pipeline; the IR path no longer depends on the AST `compile_function_body`/`compile_expr`.

### Status
- **Integration: 128/128 on BOTH legs.**
- **Stdlib: 14/14 on BOTH legs**, and **all 14 ASan-clean on the IR leg.**
- Non-skipped examples run on the IR leg; lin-ir unit tests pass; AST leg fully green.

### Final batch of fixes (beyond checkpoint 8)
- **resolve_lin_str** (runtime): compare the full leading u64 (not byte 0) to tell a boxed
  TaggedVal from a raw LinString — a string whose refcount low-byte == TAG_STR(6) no longer
  mis-unboxes (the IR path's deferred releases push refcounts higher than the AST path).
- **Runtime key-tag Index dispatch**: for `obj[k]` where obj is Json and k is a runtime-boxed
  value, branch on the key's tag (int → array get, string → object get). Fixes `arr[j]` where
  arr is a captured Json and j is a boxed loop variable (chunk / nested loops returned nulls).
- **push / array_set / object_set element ownership**: a fresh element transfers its +1 into
  the container (codegen doesn't retain / the object_set box-release cancels its retain); a
  borrowed element is retained. Fixes zip, groupBy, fromCodePoints (`[[null,null],…]` / UAFs).
- **match arm returning the scrutinee**: transfer the scrutinee's ownership out of the
  enclosing scope so it isn't released while still live as the match result.
- **Is(Object) pattern**: `is { "type": "error", .. }` now uses the object field-check path
  (HasPattern + value constraints), shared with `has`. The generic `Is` arm did a bare tag
  check against `Type::Never`'s tag (0xFF), so object patterns never matched — `render` on a
  missing file took the wrong arm and returned garbage.
- **lin_tagged_retain** + tag-aware IR `Retain` for union temps (lin_rc_retain would corrupt
  the tag byte at offset 0 of a TaggedVal).
- **Cross-module FuncId collision** (checkpoint 8): per-module `ir_anon_prefix` on
  `__lin_fn_<id>` symbols.

### Milestone 2 is now UNBLOCKED
Phase 10 (delete the legacy AST path) can proceed: `register_import` no longer needs the AST
compiler. `compile_import_from_ir` is the IR-path import compiler.
