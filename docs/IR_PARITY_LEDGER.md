# IR Parity Burn-Down Ledger

Tracks the failure set of the integration suite run on the **IR path**
(`LIN_USE_IR=1 cargo test -p lin --test integration`) as we bring it to parity
with the TypedAST path. Per the plan, this set must shrink monotonically to zero
by the Phase 8 parity gate.

Working branch: `ir-sole-path` (worktree at `/tmp/lin-ir-sole-path`, off `master` @ `fa2943e`).

## Baseline — Phase 0 (start)

- **AST leg:** 128 integration + 33 type_check + 6 snapshots + 6 lin_ir unit = **green, 0 failures**.
- **IR leg (integration):** **7 passed / 121 failed** of 128.

The 7 "passes" are all compile-time-error or formatter tests that never reach IR
codegen (`test_cannot_assign_immutable_error`, `test_division_by_zero_error`,
`test_fmt_idempotent`, `test_if_old_syntax_error`, `test_modulo_by_zero_error`,
`test_object_spread_null_error`, `test_undefined_variable_error`). **No program
that actually executes IR-generated code currently works.**

### Root-cause confirmed at baseline
`test_hello_world` builds and exits 0 but prints nothing. The emitted `.ll` shows
`main()` creating the `"hello world"` string and immediately releasing it — **the
`print` call was dropped entirely during lowering**, even though `print`/`lin_print`
is one of the 5 "mapped" intrinsics. So the gap is broader than missing intrinsic
variants: imported-function call emission and intrinsic dispatch through imported
wrappers are not wired in the IR path. Phase 1 must address call lowering, not just
the intrinsic name table.

## Phase 1 discovery — import resolution is a hidden foundational gap

The earlier exploration reported lowering "covers all 7 TypedStmt variants except
IndexSet." That is misleading: `lower_stmt`'s `Import`/`ForeignImport` arms
(`lower.rs:303-317`) only allocate **placeholder temps** — they do not connect an
import binding to the compiled target function. Consequently `lower_call`
(`lower.rs:594-618`) finds the import slot is neither an `intrinsic_slot` nor a
`global_fn_slot`, falls through, and emits an **indirect call on a dead placeholder
temp** — which the IR codegen drops to null. So **every call to an imported symbol
silently vanishes**, which is why `print` (and therefore essentially every real
program) produces no output. This is the dominant cause of the 121 failures, and it
sits *below* the intrinsic-catalogue work the plan scheduled for Phase 1.

`std/io`'s `print` is a normal exported `val` lowered to LLVM `std_io_print`
(`{module_key}_{name}` mangling, codegen `register_import`). The IR `Call`
handler's `CallTarget::Named(name)` arm already resolves via
`self.module.get_function(name)` (codegen.rs:7190) — so the fix is to make lowering
resolve import slots to `Named("<module_key>_<name>")` (and imported non-fn vals to
their `{module_key}_{name}__val` wrappers), rather than to placeholder temps.
`lower_module` will need the import map / module-key info that today only codegen has.

**Revised Phase 1 scope:** (a) thread import resolution into `lower_module` and emit
real `Named` targets for import/foreign-import slots; (b) THEN the intrinsic-name
catalogue; (c) CI scaffolding. Item (a) was not in the approved plan's Phase 1 and is
a prerequisite for any program to run on the IR path.

## Remaining failures after Phase 1 foundation (74)

Bucketed against the plan's later phases — confirms the remaining work maps onto
the scheduled phases rather than more hidden foundational gaps:

- **Loops / iteration (Phase 4):** for_and_range, map_filter_reduce, iter_builtin,
  iterator_restart, chaining, multiline_chain, stdlib_array_* — control-flow
  intrinsics still lower to no-ops (`_ => null`).
- **Pattern matching / match (Phase 4):** pattern_matching_is/has,
  array_pattern_matching_*, tagged_unions, string_literal_pattern,
  non_exhaustive_match_error, tco_in_match, match_with_block_body.
- **Partial application (Phase 6):** functions_and_partial_application,
  dot_partial_application, partial_application_chain, higher_order_functions.
- **TCO (Phase 7):** tail_call_optimization, recursion, recursive_fibonacci,
  mutual_recursion_via_forward_decl.
- **Async (Phase 5):** async_await_basic, async_val_capture, parallel_three_thunks,
  thread_pool_async, worker_request_reply.
- **Closures/var:** closures_and_var, multiple_closures_share_var,
  forward_reference_in_closure.
- **fs/http/server (need investigation — may share a common cause):** fs_*, http_*,
  server_*, io_lines/io_read.
- **Misc to investigate:** equality, not_equal, numeric_comparison, string_comparison,
  if_expressions, if_block_branches, chained_if_else, continuation_*,
  index_assign (IndexSet — Phase 2), keys_values_entries, push_and_concat,
  nested_objects_access, object_equality_deep, object/array_rest_destructuring,
  is_has_as_boolean_expressions, speculative_reads_typed_union, multi_param_lambda,
  multi_statement_*_lambda/paren, interp_with_expressions, array_oob_error,
  mixed_numeric_operations.

## Progress log

| Phase | IR-leg failures | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 0 (baseline) | 121 / 128 | starting point |
| 1a (import resolution) | 83 / 128 | resolve import/foreign slots to `Named` targets + box concrete args to Json params; 45 passing. AST leg still 128/128. |
| 1b (top-level fn FuncId) | 77 / 128 | top-level fn vals reused a fresh FuncId instead of the pre-assigned `global_fn_slots` id (Direct calls panicked); also main must be FuncId(0). 51 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 1c (ToString by input type) | 74 / 128 | `compile_to_string_value` dispatched on LLVM value kind, treating `Str` as a tagged ptr (broke string interp). Thread arg types into `compile_ir_intrinsic`; delegate to type-driven `value_to_string_simple`. 54 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 1d (boxed-object index) | 61 / 128 | `Index` carried no object/key types, so indexing a Json-boxed object (e.g. `stat(p)["size"]`) called `lin_object_get` on the `TaggedVal*` directly → null. Added `obj_ty`/`key_ty` to the `Index` instruction; unbox boxed containers/keys before runtime accessors. Unblocked the fs/http/server cluster. 67 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 2 (IndexSet + flat read) | 59 / 128 | added `IndexSet` IR instruction + `compile_ir_index_set` (object/array/dynamic dispatch); fixed `compile_ir_index` to use `flat_array_get`/`lin_array_get_tagged` per result type (was always tagged → garbage for flat scalar arrays). 69 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 2b (if-branch RC scope) | 59 / 128 | **heap-corruption fix:** `lower_if` registered branch-local heap temps in the enclosing scope, so the merge block released both branches' temps (only one branch ran) → SIGABRT. Each branch now gets its own ownership scope. No count change but fixes latent UB; validates the ASan plan. AST leg 128/128. |
| 2c (Binary operand type) | 53 / 128 | `Binary` carried only the result type, so `==`/comparisons got `lty=Bool` and did scalar compares instead of object/array deep equality (`{..}=={..}` → false). Added `operand_ty` to `Binary`; pass it to `compile_eq`/`compile_cmp`. 75 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4a (Phi / SSA merge) | 45 / 128 | the IR codegen had **no SSA merge** — `lower_if` copied both branches into a shared temp, and the single-pass codegen let the last-compiled branch win for both runtime paths (if-expressions crashed/wrong). Added a `Phi` IR instruction (records actual predecessor block per branch) + LLVM phi codegen with deferred backpatch (so loop back-edge values resolve). 83 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4b (named-fn closure wrap) | 41 / 128 | passing a named (capture-less) function as a `Function` param stored the raw fn ptr in a closure struct, but call sites invoke `fn_ptr(env, args...)` → env shifted all args (`apply(add,7)`→7 not 14). Wrap capture-less `MakeClosure` targets via `wrap_named_fn_as_closure`. 87 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4c (loops as IR blocks) | 36 / 128 | lowered for/while/map/filter/reduce/range to explicit LinIR CFG (header phi + back-edge); added ArrayAlloc/FlatArray intrinsic codegen; callback ABI coercion (box args to Json params, coerce fn returns); **heap-box escaping values** (compile_ir_box/coerce used a stack alloca → dangling boxed returns, the `[object]` bug); union-operand arithmetic re-boxes when result is Json. 92 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4d (Function-arg RC) | 34 / 128 | AST-compiled callees release their Function-typed params at return, so a closure passed from IR-main was freed by the callee then released again at module exit → double-free segfault. Retain Function-typed args before Named/Direct calls. 94 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4e (match Phi + arg/field boxing) | 33 / 128 | `lower_match` used the same broken shared-Copy merge as if (→ `[object]`); now emits a Phi and boxes the scrutinee for `is`/`has` tag tests. Box concrete args to Json params for global (Direct) calls too. Add `obj_ty` to `FieldGet` and unbox boxed-object containers (fixes destructure of a boxed param). 95 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 4f (literal patterns + panic term) | 31 / 128 | `is "lit"` patterns were lowered as type-only checks (matched any same-typed value); now emit a value equality (`lin_tagged_eq`, fixed to i8 return + literal boxed to Json). Removed the double-terminator from `Panic` codegen (it emitted `unreachable` AND the IR terminator did → verifier error). 97 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 7 (TCO TailCall) | 30 / 128 | implemented the `TailCall` terminator (was a `build_unreachable` stub → deep self-recursion stack-overflowed). Functions with a tail call get a param-alloca prologue + loop-header that reloads params each iteration; `TailCall` stores new args and branches back. Marked post-tail-call blocks "diverged" so they don't become phi predecessors. `count(1_000_000,0)` now returns without overflow. 98 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 6 (partial application) | 28 / 128 | under-applied Direct/Named calls (args < arity, Function result) now build a partial-application closure via a value-input port of `build_partial_application`. `add(5)(10)`→15. 100 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 6b (narrowed LocalGet unbox) | 27 / 128 | a Json slot narrowed to a concrete type in a match arm (e.g. `is String => x`) read the boxed value without unboxing → null/garbage. `LocalGet` now emits a `Coerce` when the stored slot type is union but the use wants concrete. 101 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 6c (closure env + uniform return) | 27 / 128 | closures capturing values crashed: env reads used `lin_object_get` on the raw env struct, and a closure returning a concrete scalar was called via the opaque-Function ABI expecting a ptr return. Added an `EnvCapture` IR instruction (raw struct load at offset 8+i*8) and made closures use a uniform boxed (Json) return ABI. Capturing-param closures work (`adder(10)(5)`→15); mutable var-capture-by-ref still pending. 101 passing. AST leg 128/128. |

## Status checkpoint (Phases 1–7 substantially complete)

**IR-leg integration: 103 / 128 passing** (from a 7/128 baseline). AST leg: **128/128
throughout**. ~21 commits, each verified.

Architecture delivered (Option B):
- Import/foreign call resolution; top-level FuncId fix; ToString-by-type.
- Index/IndexSet/FieldGet carry object/key types; box/unbox at boundaries; flat vs
  tagged array reads.
- **Phi-based SSA merge** (if-exprs, match) with deferred back-edge backpatch.
- **Loops as explicit IR blocks** (for/while/map/filter/reduce/range) + ArrayAlloc/
  FlatArray intrinsics; callback ABI (box args to Json params, uniform boxed closure
  return, re-box union arithmetic).
- **Closures**: EnvCapture instruction (raw env-struct load); capture-less wrapping;
  uniform boxed return ABI.
- **TCO**: structural TailCall loop transform (param allocas + header reload).
- **Partial application** (value-input port).
- Heap-boxing of escaping values; Function-arg retain to balance callee consume;
  narrowed-slot unbox; Val/Var + array-element coercion to declared representation;
  mixed int/float widening; literal-pattern value equality.

### Remaining failures (25), by area
- **Closures / curry / mutable var-capture (≈5):** closures_and_var,
  multiple_closures_share_var, higher_order_functions, partial_application_chain,
  forward_reference_in_closure. Curried-closure return ABI when the inner fn type is
  inferred; mutable `var` captured by reference (heap cell) not yet modelled in IR.
- **Array pattern / rest destructuring (≈4):** array_pattern_matching_is/has,
  array_rest_destructuring, object_rest_destructuring. Rest slicing + array-pattern
  binding need IR support.
- **Async / concurrency (≈5):** async_await_basic, async_val_capture,
  parallel_three_thunks, thread_pool_async, worker_request_reply. IR codegen for
  async/await/exit exists; the stdlib wrappers are still AST-compiled, so full parity
  needs the IR path to compile imports too (or the wrapper RC interaction resolved).
- **Iterators (2):** iter_builtin, iterator_restart — `lin_iter` not yet lowered.
- **Heterogeneous-literal boxing (≈3):** tagged_unions, tostring_objects_and_arrays,
  speculative_reads_typed_union — boolean (and null) boxing inside mixed Json arrays.
- **stdlib array fns (2):** stdlib_array_find_some_every, flatmap_indexof_reverse.
- **FFI / fs (2):** ffi_end_to_end_c_library, fs_read_lines.
- **TCO (1):** tail_call_optimization — a specific shape still failing (basic + deep TCO work).
- **pattern_matching_has (1).**

## Checkpoint 2 — 113/128 (Phases 1–7 + most edge cases)

Since the last checkpoint (103): uniform closure return ABI completed (curried/HOF
calls), array rest + array pattern matching, object rest, `iter()` as IR blocks,
mixed int/float widening, has-pattern value constraints, if-branch result coercion.
AST leg green throughout.

### Remaining (15) — root causes identified
1. **Mutable `var` captured by closure (heap cell)** — `closures_and_var`,
   `multiple_closures_share_var`, and (via stdlib `some`/`every`, which mutate a
   captured `var` inside a `lin_while` body) `stdlib_array_find_some_every`. The IR
   models `var` as a plain SSA temp; captured-and-mutated `var` needs a heap cell shared
   by reference (ADR-015). Largest remaining piece; comparable in size to the loop work.
2. **RC of an object returned from a function then matched** — `tagged_unions`,
   `tostring_objects_and_arrays`, `speculative_reads_typed_union`. A `match`/`has` on a
   freshly-returned object reads a dangling entry key — an RC-ordering bug in how the
   object's interior is owned across the function-return + match boundary.
3. **Async/concurrency** — `async_val_capture`, `parallel_three_thunks`,
   `thread_pool_async`, `worker_request_reply`. IR async/await codegen exists, but the
   stdlib async wrappers are AST-compiled; full parity needs the IR path to compile
   imports too (Phase 9 territory) or the wrapper RC interaction resolved.
4. **FFI / fs** — `ffi_end_to_end_c_library`, `fs_read_lines`.
5. **Misc** — `partial_application_chain`, `pattern_matching_has`,
   `stdlib_array_flatmap_indexof_reverse`, `tail_call_optimization` (a specific shape).

## Checkpoint 3 — 114/128 (stable stopping point)

Net since checkpoint 2: object-return RC fix (function boxing its result kept the raw
object too), array/object rest, iter, has-value-constraints, mixed numeric widening.

**14 remaining**, dominated by two hard themes — both surfaced as real heap corruption
(`stdlib/` run reports `malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk`, validating the planned ASan leg):

1. **Mutable `var` captured by a closure** (heap-cell semantics, ADR-015) — not yet
   modelled in the IR (var is a plain SSA temp). Blocks closures_and_var,
   multiple_closures_share_var, and stdlib some/every (→ stdlib_array_find_some_every).
   This is the single largest remaining feature (comparable to the loop/TCO work):
   needs cell alloc + load/store-through-cell + capture-cell-pointer across lowering,
   the IR model, and codegen.
2. **RC ordering for boxed objects flowing through match value-constraints** —
   tagged_unions, speculative_reads_typed_union (and contributes to the var/async
   crashes). The has-pattern value-constraint path (Index read + boxed literal compare)
   leaks/aliases; flaky crash vs empty output indicates a missing release or aliasing read.

Plus: async/concurrency (async_val_capture, worker_request_reply — stdlib async wrappers
are AST-compiled), FFI/fs (ffi_end_to_end_c_library, fs_read_lines), and one-offs
(partial_application_chain, pattern_matching_has, tail_call_optimization,
tostring_objects_and_arrays).

### Recommended next steps (in order)
- Add the **ASan/LSan CI leg + RC-stress fixtures** (deferred Phase 1 infra) BEFORE
  further RC work — the long-tail is now clearly memory-safety-bound.
- Implement mutable-var heap cells (biggest unlock).
- Resolve the has-value-constraint RC aliasing.
- Then the parity gate (Phase 8) and milestone-1 merge ask.

## Checkpoint 4 — 124/128 (strong stopping point)

Since checkpoint 3 (120): tagged_unions (multi-match + has value-constraints, via per-arm
ownership scopes + scoped value-constraint temps + branchless has/arraylen helpers),
stdlib some/every (box `==` rhs by value kind), fs_read_lines (any-width int array index),
closures-stored-in-arrays + multiple_closures_share_var (retain Function array elements +
unbox boxed callee), mutable-var-capture heap cells, array/object rest, iter, partial
application, TCO (incl. Int64), guards. **AST leg green (128/128) throughout; ~30 commits.**

### Final remaining (4) — each needs a distinct, non-trivial feature
1. **async_val_capture** — root cause found: a closure that references a top-level
   (module-level) `val` reads a placeholder instead of the value. The IR path lowers
   module vals into `main`'s slots; closures can't see them. The AST path emits them as
   LLVM globals (`global_val_slots`) and loads from there. Fix: lower top-level non-fn
   vals as globals (or capture-by-value into closures). Also blocks any closure over a
   module val.
2. **partial_application_chain** — `add3(1)(2)(3)`: a partial-application wrapper called
   with fewer args than its remaining params must itself partially apply. Indirect closure
   calls carry no arity, so under-application isn't detected. Needs arity metadata on
   closures or a curried-wrapper representation.
3. **ffi_end_to_end_c_library** — FFI: `import foreign` C symbol linkage on the IR path.
4. **worker_request_reply** — worker-thread concurrency primitives (thread pool / channels).

### Recommended next steps
- Add the **ASan/LSan CI leg + RC-stress fixtures** (deferred Phase 1 infra). The many
  RC fixes in checkpoints 2–4 (heap-box escaping values, per-branch/arm scopes,
  function-arg/array-element retains, null handling) are exactly what a sanitizer leg
  guards; it should land before the parity gate.
- Module-global vals in closures (unblocks async_val_capture).
- Then the Phase 8 parity gate and the Milestone-1 merge **ask** (still off by default).

## Checkpoint 5 — 127/128 integration (near-complete)

Since checkpoint 4 (124): module-level vals as globals (async_val_capture + any closure
over a module val), foreign-library link paths on the IR path (FFI), and void closures
return void not boxed-Json (worker_request_reply + async stdlib). FFI example runs;
11/12 non-network examples pass; 10/14 stdlib test files pass. AST leg 128/128 throughout.

### Final integration failure (1)
- **partial_application_chain** — `add3(1)(2)(3)`: a partial-application closure called
  with fewer args than its remaining params must itself partially apply. Needs closure
  arity metadata (e.g. stored in the closure struct's pad field) so the indirect call
  site can detect under-application and build a nested partial. Localized but non-trivial.

### Remaining stdlib test failures (4: array/string/object/path)
Heap-corruption crashes (e.g. `object.rs:124 misaligned pointer`, payload looks like
string bytes) under the heavy operation mix in the stdlib suites — RC-aliasing edge cases
not hit by the integration tests. These are exactly what the planned ASan/LSan leg is
meant to surface and pin down; recommend adding it before chasing them individually.

### Net status vs. the plan
All Phase 1–7 architecture is implemented and the IR path runs essentially the whole
language: literals, operators (incl. mixed numeric), strings/interp, objects/arrays
(flat + tagged), destructuring (+ rest), if/match (+ guards, literal/array/object
patterns, value constraints), closures (captures, mutable-var cells, curried, HOF),
partial application (one level), loops (for/while/map/filter/reduce/range/iter) as
explicit IR blocks, TCO, async/await, FFI, imports. The remaining items are one curried
edge case, a handful of stdlib RC corners, and worker-thread concurrency.

**Next:** ASan/LSan CI leg + RC-stress fixtures → finish the stdlib RC corners and the
curried-partial case → Phase 8 parity gate → Milestone-1 merge **ask** (IR still off by default).

## Checkpoint 6 — 127/128 integration, 10/14 stdlib (final push state)

Since checkpoint 5: tagged comparison (lin_tagged_cmp) for boxed string/number ordering
(string sort works); forced concrete return for callbacks with concrete params; box `==`
rhs by value kind; unbox boxed indirect callee; void closures return void. AST 128/128.

### Remaining integration failure (1)
- **partial_application_chain** (`add3(1)(2)(3)`): needs closure arity metadata so a
  partial closure called with too few args re-partial-applies.

### Remaining stdlib-suite failures (4: array/string/object/path)
Root-caused to a specific **AST-stdlib ↔ IR-closure return-ABI** corner:
higher-order stdlib functions (groupBy, countBy, …) take a callback with a Json/TypeVar
param and a CONCRETE return (e.g. `keyFn: (Json) => String`). AST's
`build_closure_call_typed` calls TypeVar-param closures with a boxed (ptr) return and then
unboxes the result. An IR closure under the uniform boxed ABI returns a boxed value, which
AST unboxes — but the round-trip mis-handles a `String` payload (crash reads the string's
data bytes as a pointer, e.g. `0x6c6c61` = "all"). The closure itself is correct (calling
keyFn directly works); the defect is at the AST-callee/IR-closure boundary for
concrete-return-over-Json callbacks. Needs the IR closure's return convention reconciled
with AST `build_closure_call_typed`'s unbox-on-TypeVar-params rule.

The integration suite — the canonical parity measure — is 127/128 and stable. The stdlib
suites stress higher-order interop more heavily and surface this one boundary issue plus
its downstream RC effects.
