# IR Parity Burn-Down Ledger

Tracks the failure set of the integration suite run on the **IR path**
(`LIN_USE_IR=1 cargo test -p lin --test integration`) as we bring it to parity
with the TypedAST path. Per the plan, this set must shrink monotonically to zero
by the Phase 8 parity gate.

Working branch: `ir-sole-path` (worktree at `/tmp/lin-ir-sole-path`, off `master` @ `fa2943e`).

## Baseline — Phase 0 (start)

- **AST leg:** 128 integration + 33 type_check + 6 snapshots + 6 lin_ir unit = **green, 0 failures**.
- **IR leg (integration):** **7 passed / 121 failed** of 128.

The 7 "passes" are all compile-time-error or formatter tests that never reach IR
codegen (`test_cannot_assign_immutable_error`, `test_division_by_zero_error`,
`test_fmt_idempotent`, `test_if_old_syntax_error`, `test_modulo_by_zero_error`,
`test_object_spread_null_error`, `test_undefined_variable_error`). **No program
that actually executes IR-generated code currently works.**

### Root-cause confirmed at baseline
`test_hello_world` builds and exits 0 but prints nothing. The emitted `.ll` shows
`main()` creating the `"hello world"` string and immediately releasing it — **the
`print` call was dropped entirely during lowering**, even though `print`/`lin_print`
is one of the 5 "mapped" intrinsics. So the gap is broader than missing intrinsic
variants: imported-function call emission and intrinsic dispatch through imported
wrappers are not wired in the IR path. Phase 1 must address call lowering, not just
the intrinsic name table.

## Phase 1 discovery — import resolution is a hidden foundational gap

The earlier exploration reported lowering "covers all 7 TypedStmt variants except
IndexSet." That is misleading: `lower_stmt`'s `Import`/`ForeignImport` arms
(`lower.rs:303-317`) only allocate **placeholder temps** — they do not connect an
import binding to the compiled target function. Consequently `lower_call`
(`lower.rs:594-618`) finds the import slot is neither an `intrinsic_slot` nor a
`global_fn_slot`, falls through, and emits an **indirect call on a dead placeholder
temp** — which the IR codegen drops to null. So **every call to an imported symbol
silently vanishes**, which is why `print` (and therefore essentially every real
program) produces no output. This is the dominant cause of the 121 failures, and it
sits *below* the intrinsic-catalogue work the plan scheduled for Phase 1.

`std/io`'s `print` is a normal exported `val` lowered to LLVM `std_io_print`
(`{module_key}_{name}` mangling, codegen `register_import`). The IR `Call`
handler's `CallTarget::Named(name)` arm already resolves via
`self.module.get_function(name)` (codegen.rs:7190) — so the fix is to make lowering
resolve import slots to `Named("<module_key>_<name>")` (and imported non-fn vals to
their `{module_key}_{name}__val` wrappers), rather than to placeholder temps.
`lower_module` will need the import map / module-key info that today only codegen has.

**Revised Phase 1 scope:** (a) thread import resolution into `lower_module` and emit
real `Named` targets for import/foreign-import slots; (b) THEN the intrinsic-name
catalogue; (c) CI scaffolding. Item (a) was not in the approved plan's Phase 1 and is
a prerequisite for any program to run on the IR path.

## Remaining failures after Phase 1 foundation (74)

Bucketed against the plan's later phases — confirms the remaining work maps onto
the scheduled phases rather than more hidden foundational gaps:

- **Loops / iteration (Phase 4):** for_and_range, map_filter_reduce, iter_builtin,
  iterator_restart, chaining, multiline_chain, stdlib_array_* — control-flow
  intrinsics still lower to no-ops (`_ => null`).
- **Pattern matching / match (Phase 4):** pattern_matching_is/has,
  array_pattern_matching_*, tagged_unions, string_literal_pattern,
  non_exhaustive_match_error, tco_in_match, match_with_block_body.
- **Partial application (Phase 6):** functions_and_partial_application,
  dot_partial_application, partial_application_chain, higher_order_functions.
- **TCO (Phase 7):** tail_call_optimization, recursion, recursive_fibonacci,
  mutual_recursion_via_forward_decl.
- **Async (Phase 5):** async_await_basic, async_val_capture, parallel_three_thunks,
  thread_pool_async, worker_request_reply.
- **Closures/var:** closures_and_var, multiple_closures_share_var,
  forward_reference_in_closure.
- **fs/http/server (need investigation — may share a common cause):** fs_*, http_*,
  server_*, io_lines/io_read.
- **Misc to investigate:** equality, not_equal, numeric_comparison, string_comparison,
  if_expressions, if_block_branches, chained_if_else, continuation_*,
  index_assign (IndexSet — Phase 2), keys_values_entries, push_and_concat,
  nested_objects_access, object_equality_deep, object/array_rest_destructuring,
  is_has_as_boolean_expressions, speculative_reads_typed_union, multi_param_lambda,
  multi_statement_*_lambda/paren, interp_with_expressions, array_oob_error,
  mixed_numeric_operations.

## Progress log

| Phase | IR-leg failures | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 0 (baseline) | 121 / 128 | starting point |
| 1a (import resolution) | 83 / 128 | resolve import/foreign slots to `Named` targets + box concrete args to Json params; 45 passing. AST leg still 128/128. |
| 1b (top-level fn FuncId) | 77 / 128 | top-level fn vals reused a fresh FuncId instead of the pre-assigned `global_fn_slots` id (Direct calls panicked); also main must be FuncId(0). 51 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
| 1c (ToString by input type) | 74 / 128 | `compile_to_string_value` dispatched on LLVM value kind, treating `Str` as a tagged ptr (broke string interp). Thread arg types into `compile_ir_intrinsic`; delegate to type-driven `value_to_string_simple`. 54 passing. AST leg 128/128. |
