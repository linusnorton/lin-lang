# Memory Management in Lin

Lin uses **deterministic reference counting (RC)** for all heap-allocated values. There are no GC pauses, no background threads, and no programmer annotations required for the common case. This document explains the design, the runtime layout, the compiler strategy, and the roadmap for future improvements.

---

## Heap-allocated types

Five types live on the heap and carry a `u32` refcount as their first field:

| Type | Runtime struct | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| `String` | `LinString` | `refcount:u32 \| len:u32 \| data:[u8]` |
| `T[]` (tagged) | `LinArray` (elem_tag=0xFF) | `refcount:u32 \| elem_tag:u8 \| _pad \| len:u64 \| cap:u64 \| data:*LinArrayElem` |
| `T[]` (flat scalar) | `LinArray` (elem_tag≠0xFF) | same header; `data` points to raw `T` elements |
| `{…}` object | `LinObject` | `refcount:u32 \| len:u32 \| cap:u32 \| _pad \| entries:*LinObjectEntry` |
| `(…) => …` closure | `LinClosure` | `refcount:u32 \| _pad:u32 \| fn_ptr:ptr \| env_ptr:ptr \| env_size:u64` (32 bytes) |

Scalars (`Int32`, `Int64`, `Float32`, `Float64`, `Bool`, `Null`) are stored unboxed as LLVM primitives and carry no refcount.

### Tagged union (`TaggedVal`)

Union-typed (`Json`, unresolved `TypeVar`) values are heap-boxed as `TaggedVal { tag:u8, _pad:[u8;7], payload:u64 }`. The payload is either an inline scalar or a pointer to one of the types above. `lin_tagged_release` decrements the inner pointer's refcount then frees the 16-byte box.

---

## Reference counting mechanics

### Retain / Release functions

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lin_rc_retain(ptr)` | Increments `*(ptr as *u32)` — generic, works on any RC type |
| `lin_string_release(s)` | Decrements refcount; frees the single allocation when zero |
| `lin_array_release(arr)` | Decrements refcount; when zero, **recursively releases** all heap-typed elements (TAG_STR, TAG_ARRAY, TAG_OBJECT, TAG_FUNCTION) then frees header + data buffer |
| `lin_object_release(obj)` | Decrements refcount; when zero, **recursively releases** all keys (always `LinString*`) and heap-typed values, then frees entries + header |
| `lin_closure_release(ptr)` | Decrements refcount; when zero, frees the env allocation (size stored at offset 24 in the closure struct) then frees the 32-byte closure struct |
| `lin_tagged_release(p)` | Releases the inner heap value, then frees the `TaggedVal` box |

The recursive release in `lin_array_release` and `lin_object_release` means **nested structures are freed correctly without compiler assistance**. Flat scalar arrays (int/float elements) have no pointer payloads and skip recursion.

### Closure struct layout (32 bytes)

```
Offset  Field       Type    Notes
0       refcount    u32     Incremented on retain, freed when reaches 0
4       _pad        u32     Alignment padding
8       fn_ptr      ptr     Pointer to LLVM function (env_ptr, args...) -> ret
16      env_ptr     ptr     Pointer to heap env struct; null for non-capturing closures
24      env_size    u64     Byte-size of env allocation; 0 for non-capturing closures
```

All closures — capturing and non-capturing — use this uniform 32-byte layout. Non-capturing closures have `env_ptr = null` and `env_size = 0`. The uniform calling convention `fn_ptr(env_ptr, args...)` is unchanged.

---

## Compiler RC strategy

### Current pipeline (TypedAST → LLVM)

The compiler inserts release calls **manually at consumption points**:

- `lin_string_release` after `print` (for numeric-to-string temporaries) and inside `compile_string_interp` for string accumulator temps.
- `lin_array_release` / `lin_object_release` after `for`/`iter` loops where the iterable is a freshly allocated value.
- `lin_closure_release` is declared but not yet systematically emitted (see roadmap).

### Planned pipeline (LinIR → LLVM)

The `lin-ir` crate contains a flat 3-address IR (`LinModule`) with explicit `Retain` and `Release` instructions, a backward-dataflow liveness analysis (`liveness.rs`), and a Perceus-style RC elision pass (`rc_elide.rs`). Once the LinIR pipeline is wired into production (`lin-compile/src/lib.rs`), RC will be inserted systematically during lowering and redundant pairs elided before codegen.

The lowering design (`lower.rs` line 8 comment) already specifies the intent: "RC instructions are inserted pessimistically here; the rc_elide pass removes provably redundant pairs."

---

## Perceus elision (RC elision pass)

The elision pass in `lin-ir/src/rc_elide.rs` implements a conservative approximation of the Perceus algorithm (Reinking et al., PLDI 2021):

1. Run liveness analysis over the function.
2. For each `Retain { val }`, search forward for a matching `Release { val }`.
3. If the path between them contains **no** call, heap allocation, or aliasing release — the value was never shared, so both instructions are redundant and are removed.

**Current limitations** (see roadmap):
- Single-block only: pairs that span basic block boundaries are not elided.
- Not yet integrated into the production pipeline.

**Planned extension (Phase 4)**:
- Use `live_out[block]` to detect last-use releases.
- Extend pair search across block boundaries via BFS on the CFG.
- When the analysis proves a value is uniquely owned, downgrade `Release` to a direct free (skip the decrement check). This is the core Perceus optimization.

## Cycle handling

Lin uses **pure reference counting with no cycle detection**. Reference cycles between heap objects will leak memory. This is a documented design decision (ADR-039).

**Recommended practice**: Avoid creating long-lived reference cycles. If cycles are unavoidable (e.g., a graph algorithm), break them explicitly before the data becomes unreachable by setting a field to `Null`.

**Future options**:
- **Option B — Weak references**: Add a `Weak<T>` type that does not increment refcount. When the last strong reference is released, weak references become `Null`. Requires a tombstone flag in the header and a new type in `lin-check`.
- **Option C — ORC-style trial deletion**: When an object's refcount decrements but stays >0, add it to a "potential cycle root" set. Periodically run trial deletion (tentatively decrement reachable counts; objects that reach zero are cyclic garbage). This is how Nim ORC works. Gate behind a `--orc` flag.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Runtime correctness (complete)

| Task | Status | Files |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 Recursive array release | ✅ Done | `lin-runtime/src/array.rs` |
| 1.2 Recursive object release | ✅ Done | `lin-runtime/src/object.rs` |
| 1.3 Closure refcount + `lin_closure_release` | ✅ Done | `lin-runtime/src/memory.rs`, `lin-codegen/src/codegen.rs` |
| 1.4 Tactical TaggedVal box leak fix | ✅ Done | `lin-codegen/src/codegen.rs` |
| Option A: Document cycle limitation | ✅ Done | `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-039 |

### Phase 2 — Systematic RC emission in codegen (planned)

Replace ad-hoc release calls with a coverage-complete ownership model. Define owned vs. borrowed expression kinds; emit releases at scope-exit points (block end, branch end, function return); emit retains on shared use. Operates in the TypedAST → LLVM path as a foundation before Phase 3 refactors it.

Key file: `lin-codegen/src/codegen.rs`

### Phase 3 — Wire LinIR into production (planned)

Route compilation through `lower_module` → `elide_rc` → `compile_module_from_ir`. Complete the RC insertion in `lower.rs` that the comment already promises. Add `compile_module_from_ir` in `codegen.rs`. Gate behind `LIN_USE_IR=1` env var until parity is confirmed.

Key files: `lin-ir/src/lower.rs`, `lin-codegen/src/codegen.rs`, `lin-compile/src/lib.rs`

### Phase 4 — Cross-block RC elision (planned)

Extend `rc_elide.rs` to search for Retain/Release pairs across block boundaries using the existing CFG and liveness data. Activate the `_liveness` variable already computed. Add a uniqueness optimization that downgrades uniquely-owned releases to direct frees.

Key files: `lin-ir/src/rc_elide.rs`, `lin-ir/src/liveness.rs`

### Phase 5 — Perceus reuse analysis / FBIP (optional, future)

When a uniquely-owned value is destroyed at the same point a same-shaped allocation occurs, reuse the freed memory instead of allocating fresh. Add `MakeReuse` / `AllocReuse` IR instructions and `lin_reuse_token` / `lin_alloc_with_reuse` runtime primitives. Primary benefit: `map`/`filter` chains that create many same-shaped intermediate arrays.

## Testing approach

- Run `cargo test --workspace` after every phase to verify no regressions.
- Run with AddressSanitizer to detect leaks and use-after-free: `RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo test --workspace` (requires nightly).
- Use `LIN_EMIT_IR=1` to inspect LLVM IR and verify retain/release instructions are present and well-placed.
- Integration tests for nested structures: `crates/lin/tests/integration.rs`.
