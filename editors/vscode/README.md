# Lin Language

Language support for [**Lin**](https://github.com/Lin-Language/Lin) — a compiled, functional programming language built around JSON data, structural typing, pattern matching, and dot-chained pipelines.

The extension bundles the `lin` compiler and `lin-lsp` language server, so there is **nothing else to install** — syntax highlighting and type-aware editing work the moment it activates on a `.lin` file.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for `.lin` files.
- **Diagnostics** — type errors and parse errors shown inline as you type.
- **Hover types** — hover over any expression to see its inferred type.
- **Go to definition** — jump to where a binding is declared.
- **Dot-completion with auto-import** — type `myArr.` and the completion list shows only functions that accept an array as their first argument (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, …). Selecting one automatically inserts the `import` at the top of the file if it isn't already there.
- **`lin` on your PATH, no install step** — when the extension is active, the bundled `lin` is automatically added to the PATH of VS Code's integrated terminal, so `lin run foo.lin` just works. To use `lin` in any shell, run **Lin: Install `lin` on PATH** from the Command Palette.

## Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Lin":

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| **Lin: Build** | Compile the active `.lin` file to a native binary. |
| **Lin: Run** | Compile and run the active `.lin` file. |
| **Lin: Test** | Run the `*.test.lin` suites in the active file's directory. |
| **Lin: Install `lin` on PATH** | Symlink the bundled `lin` into `~/.local/bin` for use in any terminal. |

## Requirements

A C linker (`cc`) must be on your `$PATH` to link compiled programs — on macOS this comes with the Xcode Command Line Tools; on Linux install `gcc` or `clang`. No LLVM installation is required; it is bundled inside `lin`.
