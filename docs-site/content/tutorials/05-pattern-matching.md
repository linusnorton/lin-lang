# Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is the primary way to inspect union types, destructure JSON-shaped data, and make exhaustive decisions in Lin.

## Basic match

```lin
import { print } from "std/io"

val describe = (x: String | Int32 | Null): String =>
  match x
    is Null   => "nothing"
    is Int32  => "a number: ${x}"
    is String => "a string: ${x}"

print(describe(null))    // nothing
print(describe(42))      // a number: 42
print(describe("hi"))    // a string: hi
```

`match` evaluates to the value of the matched arm. Every `match` must be exhaustive — if no arm matches and there is no `else`, it is a runtime error.

## `is` — exact match

`is` checks an exact type or value:

```lin
match input
  is Null    => "null"
  is "Dave"  => "Big Dave!"
  is String  => "some string"
  is Int32   => "some integer"
```

Arms are checked top-to-bottom. For literal values (`is "Dave"`), only that exact value matches.

## `has` — structural match

`has` checks that an object contains at least certain fields, allowing extra fields:

```lin
val greet = (person: Json): String =>
  match person
    has { "name": "Alice" }  => "Hello, Alice!"
    has { name, age }        =>
      "${name} is ${age} years old"
    else => "unknown person"
```

Shorthand `{ name }` in a `has` pattern binds the field to a local variable with the same name.

## `when` guards

Add a condition to a match arm with `when`:

```lin
val classify = (n: Int32): String =>
  match n
    is Int32 when n < 0  => "negative"
    is Int32 when n == 0 => "zero"
    is Int32             => "positive"
```

The arm only matches if both the pattern and the guard are satisfied. If the guard fails, matching continues with the next arm.

## `else` — catch-all

`else` matches any value not caught by an earlier arm:

```lin
match input
  is Null   => "null"
  is String => "string"
  else      => "something else"
```

## Matching tagged unions

Represent errors and results as tagged objects — then match on the tag:

```lin
val divide = (a: Float64, b: Float64): Json =>
  if b == 0.0 then { "type": "failure", "error": "division by zero" }
  else { "type": "success", "value": a / b }

val msg = match divide(10.0, 2.0)
  has { "type": "success", value } => "result: ${value}"
  has { "type": "failure", error } => "error: ${error}"
```

## Narrowing in branches

After an `is` check, the type is narrowed in the matched branch:

```lin
val process = (input: String | Int32 | Null): String =>
  match input
    is Null   => "nothing"
    is Int32  => "number times two: ${input * 2}"   // input is Int32 here
    is String => "length: ${length(input)}"          // input is String here
```

## Nested patterns

Match arms can contain blocks with local bindings:

```lin
val summarise = (result: Json): String =>
  match result
    has { "type": "success", value } =>
      val rounded = value
      "ok: ${rounded}"

    has { "type": "failure", error } =>
      val msg = "failed: ${error}"
      msg

    else => "unknown"
```
