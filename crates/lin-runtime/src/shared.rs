//! `Shared<T>` — opt-in shared *mutable* state across threads (ADR-043 §2.3.1).
//!
//! Copy-by-default (Option C) handles most cases, but a large/mutable structure that many
//! threads must read and update is better shared than copied into every thread. `Shared<T>` is
//! that escape hatch: an **atomic-refcounted** box wrapping an `RwLock` over the inner value.
//!
//! Three accessors, mapping onto the reader-writer lock:
//!   * `get(s)`      — read lock; deep-copies a snapshot OUT (concurrent with other `get`s).
//!   * `set(s, v)`   — write lock; deep-copies `v` IN, replacing the inner value.
//!   * `withLock(s, f)` — write lock held across `f`, which mutates the inner value in place;
//!                        `f`'s result is deep-copied OUT.
//!
//! Safety model (ADR-043): every value entering is copied in, every value leaving is copied
//! out, so no live reference into the inner graph escapes the lock. The box's own refcount is
//! ATOMIC (it is the thing shared across threads); the inner object graph keeps ordinary
//! non-atomic RC because it is only ever reachable while a lock is held (all access serialized;
//! concurrent `get`s only read, copying out).
//!
//! The inner value is stored as a boxed `TaggedVal*` (the universal value representation).
