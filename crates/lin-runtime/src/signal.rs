//! `std/signal` runtime intrinsics — minimal, race-free signal waiting.
//!
//! Per spec §35.8:
//! ```txt
//! waitSignal: (sig: Int32) => Int32   // block until the signal is delivered
//! ```
//!
//! ## Approach: block-then-sigwait (no handler)
//!
//! `lin_signal_wait` builds a `sigset_t` containing just the requested signal,
//! blocks that signal in the calling thread's mask via `pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK)`,
//! then calls `sigwait` on the set. `sigwait` atomically suspends the thread until a
//! signal in the set is pending, consumes it, and writes the caught signal number out.
//!
//! This is the clean, race-free idiom: because the signal is *blocked* before we wait,
//! a signal that arrives between the mask change and `sigwait` stays pending and is
//! still consumed by `sigwait` (no lost wakeup). It also avoids installing a handler
//! and the `pause()`/handler race.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! - The signal mask is **per-thread** (`pthread_sigmask`). `waitSignal` blocks and waits
//!   on the thread that calls it. Lin worker threads each have their own mask.
//! - Only a **single** signal is waited on per call (the set contains exactly `sig`).
//! - On any libc setup failure (`sigemptyset`/`sigaddset`/`pthread_sigmask`/`sigwait`),
//!   it returns -1. On success it returns the delivered signal number (== `sig`).

/// Block until signal `sig` is delivered to the calling thread; return the caught signal.
///
/// Returns the signal number on success, or -1 if any libc call fails.
