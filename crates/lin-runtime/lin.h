/**
 * lin.h — Public C/C++ header for interoperability with the Lin runtime.
 *
 * Include this header in C or C++ libraries that are called from Lin via
 * `import foreign` (spec §34). It defines the data structures that the Lin
 * compiler uses to pass and return non-primitive values across the FFI boundary.
 *
 * For numeric types (Int8–Int64, UInt8–UInt64, Float32, Float64) and Boolean,
 * Lin uses the standard C ABI: the value is passed directly in a register.
 * No special struct is needed.
 *
 * For String arguments, Lin passes a pointer to a LinString struct. The bytes
 * are UTF-8, not NUL-terminated. Copy the bytes if you need to retain them
 * after the call returns.
