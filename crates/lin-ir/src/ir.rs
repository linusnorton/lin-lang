//! Flat 3-address IR for Lin, between TypedExpr and LLVM codegen.
//!
//! Design principles:
//! - No nested expressions: every sub-expression result is named as a Temp.
//! - No phi nodes: merge-points use explicit Copy instructions to pre-allocated temps.
//! - RC operations are explicit: Retain/Release instructions for strings, arrays, objects.
//! - Liveness analysis and RC elision operate on this representation before LLVM codegen.
